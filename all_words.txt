I've had both but I prefer browns yea that's what im leaning towards too bad there's a filco majestouch 2 for 115 CAD ~95 USD if I don't get chongaged by raged Blues are decent too Tbh I don't think the diff is that big hrm too many things i want to buy :confused: I'll sleep on it Yeah prob best idea blues #1 I think they feel fairly different but the sound is also the main point i think browns are prolly at most 50% of the sound that blues make yeah browns are a lot less "clicky" imo, but i guess i just mean that personally i don't really think it's a big deal browns vs blue browns/blue vs red is a huge diff though yeah but if you like the tactile feel of knowing when you get past the actuation point its harder to tell with browns so I think it really depends on what you want out of the keyboard :gary2: NORMIES GET OUT YOU CHANGED IT :gary: RS bonus exp weekend?????? :gary3: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE gary 2 was perfect for this discussion. :^( why did you change :gary2: NORMIES GET OUT it's more accurate to present day gary what is a normie some stupid fucking /r/4chan /r9k/ meme why not just go to /b i'm 2 scared x) no gary if thats the present day gary or is he going through the stages of evolution reddit -&gt; /r/4chan -&gt; /b nah dude well at least from what i see r/4chan has way more shit from /r9k/ and /pol/ and shit plenty of stuff from /b, too but i notice more garbage from the other two whats /r9k and whats /pol politics and idk....... r9k i don't know what it's "supposed" to be for all i know is that all the posts on r/4chan that are from /r9k are super fucking autistic like purely autistic not even autistic people talking about politics just autistic people talking about their own autism and lel i'm watching 2 TV shows that have a main character named "Jimmy" xD lol whats the 2nd one jimmy neutron?

But, all Steam copies also have to run the Rockstar Client anyways to play.``` is that a dealbreaker?? nah idgaf look at the thread it says don't copy and paste it type it out yourself eks d let's try btw can you buy for me i'll cash you !! :simple_smile: i can't get it to work still :confused: why don't you try? :simple_smile: im at work u'll get in truble?? :disappointed: idk feels weird i'll get a room and try lol brb lmao aight it feels weird doing this at like my desk where everyone can see ya i feel ya okay in a room now trying this good???? uploaded a file: Shot 2015-04-14 at 3.40.58 PM.png> :O I got us 24% off :simple_smile: yeah :smile: nice :simple_smile: XD okay X) whoops this is the actual cost ? uploaded a file: Shot 2015-04-14 at 3.41.51 PM.png> oh the total lol yeah i just looked at the green numbers op op op uploaded a file: Shot 2015-04-14 at 3.43.22 PM.png> do i ca$h u now??? yah :)))) lolol or venmo me whichever is fine oh shit you already paid me :heart: square 4 life babe :square: :square: lol dammit bad decisions at work lets play today after i install 4 sure nig fucking rockstar requires you to enter the hyphens in the code nice pic on cash thx babe i dun think i have a pic :disappointed: yeah it's okay though you have $kelvin :disappointed: fucking cool guy kelvin gets to have his own name as his cashtag lel xD i think every time i go to that phone conf room i always take out my cc and buy something. lmfao that's pretty gud but yeah the reason talking on slack is good looks like work XD yeah i don't look like i'm goofing around when i'm on slack lol arent you home already? are you gonna play with a controller or mouse/keyboard not sure, maybe controller mm yeah that what im used to for GTA I already beat the main game on xbox they're FINALLY coming out with heists right? k turned in the assignment you should buy gta v too we can grief people in game more like each other :^) 8) shet you can grief people in gta v? just keep killing them when they spawn lol oh in online multiplayer nice kelvin and i are going to start a clan :^)^)^)^) yah if you dont join it u ded sheee GTA 5 time? kelvin and i have ya should I go to the pregame tonight?

Well, this is the weird issue with a weird workaround to fix. Mostly it's happening due to GTA V PC installation having troubles in communicating with your primary graphics card so workaround which is working for most of the people is to disable graphics card in device manager then launching game and at social club window switching back to device manager and enabling graphics card.

Step 1: Go to Control Panel -&gt; System -&gt; Device manager -&gt; Display adapters, then double-click on your graphics card and select disable.
Step 2: Launch the Game, run GTAVLauncher.exe
Step 3: At Social Club Page, switch to Device Manager and Enable Graphics card again by Right Click and select enable.``` gg one sec i switched to ethernet wtf im getting 100+ Mbps on speed test on gta im getting 1 MB my keyboard stopped working... my hangouts stopped working wtf is going on pls what is going on is anyone there yo can you call me through gmail idk whats going on i can't get onto the hangout api it finished downloading over night! we can play today!!!!! when i woke up i saw retry... and i got scared but it only failed the patch alright bois report from last night hooked up with a KDR bros sister in law he graduated last year she was such a sweet girl made me remember what it's like to not just bang sluts there's still awkward and tender girls out there did I make you proud daddy?

so many college students damn nice ignore the eecs/cs kids kelvin only thinking about the students not even the townies i don't think poor college kids = poor ghetto nigs the city of berkeley is about like 30% students isn't it? maybe, but we're just talking about the most ghetto/sketch parts of champaign which is where the poor black townies live well the whole town is sketchy except north berkeley you both have been there walking around on southside i don't think it's as sketch as the run down neighborhoods of champaign but it was still pretty shady walking around at night well you haven't been to the run down neighborhoods of berkeley (oakland) sheeeet, that doesn't count :disappointed: that's in oakland but its connected where does it end at least its farm country once you get out i mean, i guess that's sort of a plus yeah its a major plus :simple_smile: So much corn for bourbon nah man corn is for gas shieeeeet kevin does your work give out beer i'm sure there's some beer in the fridge but i don't really know how regularly it's stocked :dizzy_face: :astonished: :astonished: :dizzy_face: :toilet::toilet::toilet::toilet::toilet::toilet::toilet::toilet::toilet::toilet: fucking where is the WC wtf?

craigslist modeling ads page oh i already look they were looking for someone of your expertise not mine for what kind of internship? career fairs since for CS you can just go to any place and look i only ever got mine through career fairs and yeah, career fairs or they just email you driectly and be fucking annoying well i would like that fuck, i hate when they spam cold call i havent got anything i know right especially when you have work to do and they're just bothering you good thing i can add numbers to blacklists i never pick up anyways and you dgaf i just don't pick up people i don't know anymore same like if they don't have a name if its important they'll leave a message or text me if they know me and brandon, i'm sure sjsu should have like a career-finding application somewhere, right? i know our school also had an online job board specifically for students at the school yeah maybe you could try that i have that cept for my major oh yeah ive applied to all of them that i fit we had "callisto" it as a piece of shit nice, rekt never used it we had OP i-link :simple_smile: career fairs is the way to go imo not really op you talk to the person and get a feel of what they do and they will prolly also write on your resume if they think you're good yeah career fairs are ideal, and i would imagine it's more likely your resume will actually be read by someone who matters and give you a bump up if they like you doing stuff online is alright, too. but face to face stuff is definitely better so go to all the career fairs you can and bring enough resumes and don't be a dank memer when you're talking to them damnit well the career fair passed and i havent heard anything how long has it been? sometimes they just take awhile especially since you're not doing CS stuff which i think the turnaround is generally a bit shorter for compared to more traditional engineering roles wait really? waht kinda roles are you looking for? brandon isn't a CS major yo what was it, industrial engineering? no i just meant yeah i didn't know it was different well i just mean the type of recruiters at companies that hire like an industrial engineer for example basically any company and their workflow that has a process / worflow yeah would probably be slower than a cool agile company like :square: i mean, i'm not an expert, but i wouldn't be surprised if that were the case i have no idea im just curious but microsoft was prolly one of the fastest to get back to me i would imagine and boeing could have been pretty slow companies like that idk nah, it was the best jk but also i think if they talk to you through career fairs it's kind of faster it was pretty boring online applications are slow i mean i talked to a few companies but like me and all my friends said they heard nothing i would imagine the demand for people in your area is probably not crazy high so it'll just take some time maybe... im not sure just go send your resumes into a chinese sweatshop :simple_smile: lol okay ez way to increase total work output of the factory you'll be working at is lower pay and hire more workers because you're the only option around for employment anyways hue damn kevin u always come up with the best ideas but what do you think about like chances of getting a job without an internship i feel like its gonna be a bitch i personally feel like it is fairly low but i also come from an industry where its super easy to get an internship so ymmv yeah exactly i think for you, brandon, it might be a little harder but not impossible or anything and i think for CS it's definitely not hard to get a job w/o an internship uh just you won't get a job that you might want like you'll be stuck mm i guess so. and a bad place to do stuff you'll prolly be stuck doing IT or something for target or macys yeah lmao well not IT some shit like that but developing for their website .NET for Walgreens or some gay shit lol jesus i would cry i would shoot myself you already are by using .NET let's learn COBOL, kelvin that way we can go replace the COBOL knowledge experts who are all either retiring or dying and you get to work on 30 year old systems so much joy damn i think i chose the wrong major maybe we could be the only two people in the world who know COBOL and then just create our own startup and charge $100k/hr for consultation all the big banks will come to us :simple_smile: sheeeeit brandon why not go into consulting a lot of engineers do that although they have a high churn rate i think the problem is doing consulting straight out of college yeah like who would hire a fresh college grad consultant lol one of my professors uh is a private consultant i know a good amount of people who do that its not that uncommon what's their area of expertise though? cs just curious my professor? i feel like CS is kind of that weird major where you can kind of do anything i mean straight out of college one of my friends was an aerospace engineer but he took some cs classes hmm, maybe yeah i don't really know anyone who does consulting u of i people too gud for consulting jobs my friend did recently quit and will be working at box i would imagine consulting is harder to get than just a normal position is it? as like a in house constultant sorta or is the opposite true i have no idea what the fuck does a consultant even do i never looked for a consulting job is it just like, people ask you how to implement something thats not where the big bucks are at and you tell them they give advice they're fucking stupid to people about how they could improve their stuff right and that's where you tell them they're fucking stupid or at least thats how picture it and fix their shit for them right? yeah well i mean my professor recently consulted some farm i mean farms probably dont have the time and people to fix it so they hire someone to help kevin what do you listen to at work i'm listening to Coco :simple_smile: warriors hype some remix though i'm just listening to a random soundcloud recommended playlist oh so you one of those cool hipster people who uses soundcloud why do i pay for spotify :disappointed: cuz you can afford it i just use soundcloud to find music and then use google play music otherwise i mean my music tastes are all over the place so i still would prefer to have a paid music service for "normal" music do they still have those services where some people can join a room and you all queue up the same music lmao yeah lolol when everyone starts workin we can do that :heart: :simple_smile: lolol jk no one prolly listens to the same music that kevin shu does i mean or his stuff is too cool for it the point of it is discovery mang i could just fill my queue up with tswift to appease the chou-lord but you already listen to that all the time man theres nothing wrong with listening to tswift shes g8 btw b4 you guys graduated when did u apply for full time like a few months or what i applied in september so basically when school started mhm and u if u get the interview u just say although i already had an offer beginning of next year so its a bit different no i told them wait its new grads so its all going to be in june-august of the next year really unless you tell them otherwise even if u graduate in the fall it's just u have to wait till june then you tell them january or feb no a couple of months after you graduate you just tell them typically yeah what kevin said oh okay you just tell them what works for you and they'll work something out with you if it doesn't work for them then fuck them ayy lmao honestly, maybe the feedback you'd get from anyone here wouldn't even be that beneficial for you we're all CS majors so we're kinda spoiled with job finding kinda but idk its still helpful i mean some stuff is still pertinent, yeah cuz im dying not able to find an intern you still have a whole year, right? oh internship no half a year right so you want a summer internship yeah and then wrap up last semester and transition to full time right? yeah pretty much if not probably go back for masters ahh i see damn thats tough well my coworker right now did industrial engineering he went to northwestern so he did internships in chicago!! ayy lmao ayy lmao anyways he said the stuff he did was pretty dumb mostly data entry and what not so he ended up automating everything unfortunate nice found out that he liked cs better like a true engineer did consulting for cs and ended up being a software engineer lol oh really hmmm yeah i mean he said his internships didn't really have much to do with his major idk I-L-L I-N-I :simple_smile: wow well i mean for the internship they just them enter data from what i understand but like full time is less of that yeah ofc but still it's kind of disappointing to not be doing anything _real_ like wtf data entry? yeah it sounds kidna lame but its better than nothing yeah, def it's your gateway to better jobs, but nevertheless it still kinda sucks i mean its still a job kevin dont be hatin not hating on the job yeah kevin you piece of shit hating on the fact that they don't give you real work so fucking privileged shit sry I-L-L I-N-I kevin is part of the fucking tech elite bb-b-b-b-b-b-but i don't even live in Frat Mason :confused: but you live in chicago yeah not even the tech capital of the world dont you live in a swanky area where you can look at the lake hm, sorta exactly. nah i can't see the lake from my building i live in da ghettos i used to be able to last year !!! all i see is civic center and all i smell is piss when i get back to the city do you know what makes me feel like im back so, wait, does it actually smell bad in SF? i smell piss piss everywhere i can't tell if you guys exaggerate or not i feel like you must be we aren't. fuck, i need a 2nd opinion on this :disappointed: ask my parents they can testify they just kept talking about it when they visited me and im like you get used to it :disappointed: wait ur in downtown sf right? how true is this? probably pretty close deek my roomates are going to game 2 tonight deek wait why arent u going? how much were their tickets its 15 dollars if you buy it like 10 minutes before the game starts :simple_smile: nice totes :simple_smile: dude if that was a case id buy a whole row or section and flip the tickets, right? for $16? :simple_smile: yeah obviously lol it's like $160 where they sitting? All of that is true but number 2 I haven't seen dicks in public yet I've actually been to the restaurant that they mentioned for number 1 nice no im not lying about the $15 thats what happened on saturday btw i was debating between the doughnut sandwich and the waffle chicken sandwich i ended up going with the wafle chicken sandwich wait you went to the game saturday? 'House-made belgian waffle, crispy chicken strips, raspberry jam, Swiss, maple syrup, powdered sugar. Plus fries/chips' i didn't. but i couldve bought tickets for $15 i was in berkeley are u sure they were legit nobody is that dumb to sell for that cheap like average ticket is like 450 right now i think it's more that it was 10 min before and maybe dude was desperate to get rid of or they were fake cause i'm sure people would show up even later than 10 min prior to the game and still buy for more who knows maybe kelvin is talking about berkeley basketball tickets :simple_smile: ayy lmao im pretty sure if it was 10 min i would sell for like 100 its stubhub... IT WAS ON STUBHUB why can't you guys believe it wtf warriors vs pelicans game 1 it didn't sound exciting but it ended up being alright ill check stubhub 10 min b4 this game and see the price AD needs to sign with his hometown when his contract with the pels expires :simple_smile: where was he from chicago lel xD no fuck that i mean there might be more people going now chicago is garbage that they put up a fight in game 1 :anguished: nodnarb pls inb4 d rose hurts him self again brandon can you just legally change your name to nodnarb? Nodnarb Lai? ayy lmao nmo no* i think employers would hire you for your interesting and unique name :simple_smile: might as well chagne it to leshawn change your last name too Nodnarbius Laishonda so if you dont get an interview they can think you're black and hire you :simple_smile: yeah str8 away (in person interview) skip the interview tell them if they don't hire you u call them a racist you'll sue them for turning you down because of your race who could turn down Nodnarbius Lai'quelle-shonda III? thats a pretty good name Stop blowing up my phone you nigs can't you just turn off notifications unless your name is mentioned or something? :disappointed: also now you know how i feel when you guys are talking in the xD hangouts room lel xD lol yeah I turned off notifications for all slack unless its an :simple_smile: whoops what about a and yeah lol nice pinging the whole channel just now its k not like any of you guys have work except kevin :OOOOOO but hes here anyway :oo: I turned off the warning when you ping the whole channel h4h4h4h4h4 slack is work mang Also munchery detected my referral farm and denied me credit ]': lmao #rekt lol wat I should just keep getting it delivered to different buildings on campus and get free food that way oh yah this reminds me of when grubhub had a $5 discount code off your order if it was your first order that happened to caviar for a while do you know how they figured it out jason? they maxed referrals based off of the CC used time to get a new CC jason :simple_smile: their referral validations are too strong QQ which i think is pretty reasonable i don't think they keep CC info stored it's oh then you gotta figure it out how munchery does it address i think oh just put random numbers yah so my first one was delivered to soda in the address line 2 oh lel xD haha fucking real :simple_smile: hmm thats what i work with everyday lol registration forms? there's no address line 2 just apt # nice, basically addr line 2 though maybe that works apt# fuckmunchery because I live in a house xd dx yea they should be considered distinct hmm they could do address verification but i doubt it it will cost them more money what do you work on at work kelvinnnnnn? im on growth so i do onboarding onboarding? :O :oo: what does that entail for your day to day? working on training programs???? oh customer onboarding lol yeah i made that page :simple_smile: nice so you work on registration forms yeah its a form that's what i'm doing right now!! our pm is like WHY THE FUCK IS THIS SO HARD ITS JUST A FORM as in mad or bewildered bewildered nice but theres a lot of stuff we do in the backend because computers fucking suck yeah so the front end is never the problem hahaha forms are hard i need to move some fields from registration page 1 to registration page 2 and i'm sure this'll take a couple of days that should be trivial? or i guess it really depends on the controllers you're hitting to save the data and that i'm bad :disappointed: i think it's mostly because they save an entry in the DB for reg1 and reg2 I did controllers and forms too!!!!! and i need to fix up the controllers and models and tests after doing the front end lol our production is down wat oh what so you actually have to backfill data and do migrations potentially i think that sounds terrible. how large is the table? we cant do rails migrations anymore we have to do online migrations i'm not sure how large the table is, probably not too big this is a new product ahhh okay but no offense dats dumb i think it's because if people apply the table per page of reg form they want the easy to fill info in the first page so if they change their mind they still submitted something nono i mean and we can call them back or something saving it in two separate things in the database as opposed to saving an incomplete entry and then completing the entry later? yeah that probably would have been easier to work with lol yawp idk, i'm sure there was a reason for this i mean i just don't know what it was you're prolly doing REST it's because enova has technical debt just POST data to make up for financial debt that they create :simple_smile: h4h4h4h4h4 hu3hu3hu3hu3hu3 damnit i just got jury duty :enova: = :comcast: noice qq g g :square: = :nsa: :gary: = :nsa: RS bonus exp weekend?????? :arista: = :poop: teehee :simple_smile: ]': i would use something else but we already took NSA and Comcast :disappointed: :enova:, :square: = :dollar: does square operate in :pound:? :uk: :square: 8) fuck off gary your'e not welcome here no we aren't in the uk yet smd kevin we are only in the us, ca, and jp sheet :jp: i hope i finish my thesis :dizzy_face: :astonished: :astonished: i hope you fail out of college pls and don't even get your backelour i feel scrub my thesis is only like 32 pages long that seems short 32 pages double spaced in MS word? 1 inch margins? :simple_smile: MLA? it's like 1 inch margins IEEE i'm just fucking with you u fag there's actually a lot of whitespace though lel xD nice custom IEEE format w/ triple line spacing nice lol wtf my entire thesis is actually 5 sentences lel xD also 1 inch margin between the two columns how about a 72 font word on each page dang why can't my app have a freemium model and that's it so i can use stripe qq yeah fuck :square: :simple_smile: y doesn't :arista: use rails :cry: what do they use? no sure maybe django? what did you use for the form validations in that signup page, some js library or did you CSS and JS it all yourself django is pretty similar i think fak I don't think I want to write OS stuff nice come to the dank side lel xD just webapps all day JS and shitz maybe you can even use node!!! !!!\ da besss you are you still at work kevin yeah finna pz out now though need to get back to pick up package LED case lighting!!! :^) 8) don't do it jason only do systems stuff :^) 8) :^) 8) we use fieldkit for entering the data for showing it we have some janky stuff with knockout look at all these Ruby fags Python master race reporting in whats wrong with ruby what if people DDoS my app ]: ruby has some janky synta *syntax and when I code in python I'm constantly reminded of my trouser snake that being said, I haven't had much exp with ruby ruby syntax isn't jank once you learn it yeah i'm sure you're just thinking about im actually starting to like it true, it's not that bad imo the fucking question marks and exclamation points i actually like the ? and the bangs yeah same it helps me figure out why isn't there what the function is trying to do !? syntax exactly syntax?! or 8==D~~~ nice or maybe the elusve `is_array_8)` honestly, Ruby vs Python is a real nitpicky comparison `is_dank_meme_:^)` `arista.:^)` at least it's no Perl (shudder) I just learned about this lib too i don't get what kevin shu is trying to say I feel like we could invent a dank memes framework for Python using some creative metaclassing why not just name the functions dank memes and force people to type it why not make a library for meme manipulation, creation, and statistical analysis? maybe we could use that for automated pepe trading? we could start a prop pepe trading firm and make millions time to rake in the GBP then we could start a London office specializing in foreign fefe markets lmfao it would be the ultimate business greentext pepe arbitrage why am i not a dank memer like you guys im so confuse btw guys, I'm officially eskimo bros with Gary :^) 8) I did indeed doggy style that among other positions she gave very enthusiastic head as well all in all I had a great night she was also a decent conversationalist shieeeeeeet the pillow talk was great to boot we both left with a smile on our faces because we had a mutually agreeable and casual night are you proud of me Jason? I recall you saying I was a lot of talk and not enough action? or should I have stuck it in her pooper for real greatness? no that was Xiaowen fug couldn't remember who it was i said it too probably you know me i always give u shit :simple_smile: we missed 420 !:dank: /giphy 420 /giphy 420 that's for you navdip kchou now fired :simple_smile: but not for kelvin :^) 8) :^) 8) :^) 8) :^) 8) :^) 8) :^) 8) :^) 8) okay lmao ayy lmao pushed it off screen :league: later? what time anytime I'm free today why would we want to play with a no skill player like you? we already have one me :simple_smile: playing with you guys is like hardcore training I have to carry your sorry asses fucking kshu always shits the bed when in botlane i need a babysitter because i'm not old enough to play botlane by myself :confused: ]: that's the support me and jason combo not old enough to play botlane by ourselves even worse actually 2 unsupervised toddlers is worse than 1 :disappointed: /giphy doublelift carry me hard on bot btw guys if something bad happens on giphy you can delete it yah but who doesn't like teetees like dat too :simple_smile: yes so just do that and if you really need to see just google it :simple_smile: danKKK waow so racist also lel, fucking knockout xD do you like working with it ? its aight its not the worst i mean ive ever actually only actually ive never done web dev before web dev is an interesting beast I've done a fair bit of it' all ive worked with here is have you really? dyelfitness doesn't count, novi :simple_smile: ember and knockout lol we have some white walls for constructions so people are drawing on it and writing sutff on it hey mang, at my last three internships I did some cool data representation and manipulation work through web interfaces so one of them is like "I work at Square because" i thought that was d3 stuff and less real web dev someone wrote "I can't afford to leave #goldenhandcuffs" and jack just took a picture of it well, define what you mean by "web dev" if you're talking making a webpage look pretty and shit, yeah, not much of that well not only pretty, but functional i think kevin is talking about like actually building something like an MVC in javascript right? yeah and lel xD clearly the author of that comic is a backend guy probably likes it in the backend too if ya no what i'm sayin :simple_smile: I've done some mvc work, but most of it has been like coding backend and middleware now that I think about it oh, yeah i think it's more like you skip the C in MVC along with random bs in the V like javascript and CSS lol I hate the V more like i hate front end :disappointed: a lot of it is so blargh how so? it just doesn't feel very thought intensive you make it do things cause it's fucking stupid and thats it that's why nah, I do a lot of C there is a lot of shit one needs to react to and process with data manipulation but I guess I've been building more like 1-3 page apps than anything else fuck off gary you're not welcome here please go you fucking faggot reeeeeeeeeeeeeee i agree with gary on this point though. even though hes gonna be come one of those security people in caves who never comes out to see the dalight daylight ye i agree, front end isn't as thought intensive in the traditional sense it's more thought intensive from a usability perspective yeah yeah but and not like efficiency or w/e who thinks about that most of the time prolly the designer yo, making a good UI is fucking hard just get a designer ezpz lolol well there's also stuff like like what well, idk, i think writing good, organized css can be hard depending on the degree of how good you want it to be and how clean/neat it's a different set of challenges like browser support and all that stupid shit it's definitely not hard in the same way that back end stuff is hard oh we have some other front end engineers who deal with that i just use the styles yeah, same here mostly i occasionally contribute ^ basically they work entirely on the public facing web page so if they have shitty styles then they're gonna have a shitty time and my app just use their styles cause they made it a gem ye that's true so basically it really depends on what state the codebase of your company is I've yet to work with a shitty codebase hope I never do wow well, a shitty codebase in industry i work with one everyday inb4 CTC is worst codebase in school when I was doing research T_T_T_T_T_T_T its shitty cause i wrote it nah i'm sure you're just being nice, novi dude every company has shitty codebases unless they refactored everything every couple of years our company still has a monorail omg buzzwords what's a monorail? some shit? aka a *MONO*lithic *RAIL*s app ahh nice we have that too :simple_smile: why didn't it bold fuck slack piece of shit cnuapp OP i think most startups have monoliths prob since the attitude at the beginning was more like fuck this we need it to work we're slowly trying to kill it though yeah and then after a certain point it's just although the attitude now is still unmanageable fuck we need it to work yeah lmao but lets not make it janky codebases are funny mang I just hate how it's considered unprofessional to leave funny comments everywhere depends on where you work i'd imagine i'm sure lots of places don't care my dev lead was always like "bro, cmon, bro" wait we leave these comments everywhere novi works at banks and shit well more like so he's a fuccboi we're like # what the fuck is this shit or :disappointed: # how does this even work or yeah lmao damn wish I could do that or you'll see the git blames like # we have to set this so something downstream doesn't break LOLOL wtf are you doing or comments on commits i mean can I come work at square? yah :^) 8) we can sit next to each other and get trashed all the time lolol but you'd have to come to sf the smelliest shity in the world true, true, SF ain't really the place for me its k lets go to nyc yessssssssssssssss i wanna move there in a year do it and work from our new york office it's sick i'll be doing that for a week in june yeah novi h8s on chicago to see if i can stand living in the heat in nyc wouldn't be surprised if he joined you in nyc :disappointed: Chicago ain't bad, NYC is just better theres also a much better ratio in nyc well depends on what you want in a city, i suppose novi just wants to go crazy all the time pls I just like hanging out with finance people and if they happen to share my penchant for drinking and screwing, so be it nah i think it's the other way around fuccbois attract fuccbois :simple_smile: y u like finance so much he's a fratbrah I like CS, but I see it as a means to an end and not the end whats the end I'd rather have a solid technical background and move into architectural work or management isn't that what a lot of cs people do? its up or out typically i can't imagine bein a software dev for the rest of my life a lot of people go the software dev route for years they get similar pay to a lot of managers at higher engineering levels don't you guys have stuff like that at square? yeah individual contributors but a lot of people also move into management and well most individual contributors at square oversee the architecture stuff I guess it depends then but I really want to be working with people and tech at a high level more than coding understanding that is part of the reason I joined a house and got really active in it to learn actual management skills and social skills learn how to work a room and connect with the people in it in some ways I consider that more important than anything technical I've learned in the past few years regardless, we'll see where things go in the future hard to really call anything right now yeah also hard to say what the industry will be like in a couple years do you guys think there is another tech bubble? i personally don't lmao i just googled are we in another tech bubble and one of the articles was from fortune and it's talking about :arista:!!! that was a year ago. and lol im writing code for this ember app that I wrote on 7 months ago i'm just reading it for the sake of reading it lol now I have no idea how to write code for ember im looking at my own code and im like what does this mean yeah get rekt mang i don't agree with that guy hes just talking about some random trends he doesn't even look into how much vc money is actually going into the companies and the relative worth of companies and how IPOs are happening now versus 15 years ago hes comparing apples and oranges sure, but i think he's probably just trying to give a different perspective for why there might be a bubble not that it's valid from anecdotal evidence lol i read that one too lel xD also I tried to go to last lecture and they wouldnt let me in I'll just watch the stanford one they got oprah? last lecture? yea like it's part of senior week randy paul? yea wait no but by a berkeley prof what was that guys name ohhhhh pausch i see oh yah i lined up like 2 hours early for that last year was it gud?

they held it in the school auditorium and my parents and I were there for some otehr shit my parents decided to stop in and see what was going on at the school so I got dragged along there were more than a few kids there they wanted to give you the experience of being a parent they could have just gotten me a punching bag if they wanted to do that wow. are you okay you probably are already a parent you fucking babby daddy did you get abused?

i mean they'll definitely get you for battery but would they get you for attempted manslaughter too? or successful? it would actually be murder I think killing an unborn child qualifies as murder yeah murder nvm not manslaughter in like the second degree or something don't do that novi, pls pls just use the rubber even though that can fail too it's only failed once in my history of using them and that was because of a pinecone one day my friendo novi is going to be a baby daddy and i'm going to see him lose all his riches to alimony and child support :disappointed: why you guys dangle my doom in my face?

\_()_/ ( Wow Gary quit "slack"ing off and get back to work :guardsman::raising_hand: it won't let me copy paste fucking lame prob just gonna restart computer slack what's funny is if you put that into google translate it says traditional is better than simplified hahaha because it knows its true :simple_smile: xDDDD you just typed in traditional as well did i? i just have it set to simplified in the keyboard wait oh wait no i was just looking at traditional wow what a bad taiwanman and i would assume simplified would make it simplified but i guess they kept it around just to show traditional has a lot of strokes lolol this kelvin chou guy trying to be some traditional master race 0 care about the efficiency of fewer strokes :^) 8) im so bad fuck its so hard nice can switching between languages LOLOL on a mac :(((( dammit you saw im so bad at pinyin cause i couldn't read it lmao so i had to translate it did you learn whatever it's called? zhuyinfuhao? yah bopomofo i type with pinyin though bopomofo i don't know if those are actually the words whats the secondo ne that you wrote second one apparently gibberish but the first one is right i mean i feel like most people recognize both though like real chinese/tw people at least not fucking ABCs like us or maybe you prefer ABT :^))) ... yeah i mean my parents say its not too hard to use context clues and figure it out although i think its easier to go from traditional -&gt; simplified than simplified -&gt; traditional i guess it depends on the word sometimes simplified is just a straight up different symbol instead of a simplified version yeah thats what i mean and that's kinda annoying sometimes context clues for that yeah but if its complete different then its because it prolly is use fairly commonly where did you learn chinese when you were a kid? chinese school? home? chinese school i was a year behind lol and then high school and then college 2 years in high school 1 semester in college hmm, just curious since when i did chinese school i don't even remember ever being really exposed to traditional. all of the materials were very much simplified first and then maybe show a traditional version of a character when it came up i know at irvington we just could get either version of the book right? uhhh i went to a taiwanese started chinese school so... wow you prolly went to a commie one you commie bastard the rebels have invaded the US too !! although i guess technically the communist party is the rebel group yeah that became the defacto ruling group lmao this fucking guy at the very end of the clip there's a guy who's clapping and it's funny as hell what a cool guy it's official my entire match history is all losses like wtf is going oin maybe you're not as good as u think u r x) never felt so bad in my life not even when you first found out that you had herpes?

because it's the best phone out right now? iphone 6? yah you should :simple_smile: iphone 6 is solid but i don't like ios :confused: i tried it for a few days and returned it oh yeah you showed us lol i like the aesthetics and design for ios better but if you're used to like the back button and menu stuff its also a lot less customizable i like the notification shade in android His ass couldn't take the mandatory pounding one gets from owning an Apple product shade? a lot more than the notification/widget drawer in ios drawer idk why i say shade Hold me guys I just want to cuddle mm Why do I not have a qt gf to make me soup get a pretty face and get some tits i basically never use the notification and make a hole between your legs drawer All I have are slutty girls so I guess thats why well you never use it cause the ios one fucking sucks lol what do you use it for though look at notifications for one lol, but more than that also to control various application toggle settings etc customizable settings toggles and also to check the weather same shit you would use your ios notification drawer for oh i see my notifications is just on my home screen when i open my phone and yah weather makes sense i just click the weather app in the morning Fuck I could go go for a beer i would say the thing is android had the notification drawer since the very beginning almost so a lot of applications utilize it well But I know it'll be worse for me just do it dude how can beer make anything worse yeah that makes sense it was added on after the fact and I just got used to not having it yeah the hardware home button on the iphone also kinda fucked with me, too although the S6 would have the same issue also the reddit app i use on android is so much better than any ios reddit app i found lel xD i use alienblue whats wrong with it lol i mean objectively, nothing is wrong with it i just got really used to how the one i use on android works and i like it too much have you tried the one that I suggested? alienblue? yeah i used that and others on ios oh Whats so good about your android app i like the way the content is laid out and how you navigate between stuff there's a list of posts you tap a post and then the screen moves to the left and you're on a page for the individual post and there's a bar you slide up and down to reveal either the post content or the comments and at any time you can swipe right to go back to the list of posts kinda hard to explain idk wait that sounds like the same the only diff is the post content / comments nah it didn't work like that on alien blue at all wat well i really like the content/comments up/down instead of how in alien blue it's like one page post next page content next page comments oh you mean where it stays on all the posts and it just slides up and down things? you bought a iPhone 6? yeah he showed it to us and promptly threw it away to show that hes of a superior android race fucking cool guy idk i guess whichever one you get used to is the one you use kinda like toothpaste yeah, it's like using Colgate vs. liquid shit Colgate being Android and liquid, fetid shit being Apple it's like this kelvin tomato tomahto oh okay the only thing thats different is the middle bar thing but thats fairly large yah that legit ms paint diagram alien blue is aight lo-fi mockups :^) 8) mm but the bar is pretty nice and i got used to it makes sense pretty much it just has two views one that loads the content and one that loads the comments i mostly use alien blue for self posts yeah alien blue was pretty nice for self posts FUCK i think berkeley is calling me again for donations but not for reading dank memes block dat number baby ive stopped picking it up they havent called in 3 months give them your square stock :simple_smile: options and tell them to name a building after you even though you kinda already have Soda Hall :^)))) i have very little options lolol my steam name?

You guys are too good Should've fixed your gta account :( trying man sigh my computer still lags its so sad even playing single player :disappointed: i wanna wait until skylake comes out before i buy thuogh and buy that when it's full price? or buy something else and deal hunt? full price because fuck it itll be my first desktop let's all pick parts for you :simple_smile: yay pls make sure it doesnt blow up Yay bapc time that'll be like 4-5 months from now :disappointed: why not now?? i wanna wait for the new hotness processors unless you have an extra lying around I could borrow until those come out Extra hotness processors No, sorry,I don't have spare eyeballs oh yeah it probably won't even make that much of a difference though its a new microarchitecture! ah, so you're into more petite ladies I feel ya :kappa: lol i just got your joke its too early why am i awake yeah it's only like 10 new microarchitecture probably won't even do anything :^) 8) get worse performance and use more energy let's just go back to the pentium 4 the best processor of them all pls, celeron 4 lyfe sounds so impressive so are you going to get a super high end build? i feel like if you're not there's really no point in waiting for skylake I'd rather have a super rear end ya know? you already have some sweeet thundercheeeks ya fil? :simple_smile: thanks I needed to hear that I'll wear some yoga pants out today yeah prolly pretty high end im okay with dropping like 1-1.5k on it prolly since i prolly won't upgrade it for like 4 years lol although i have no idea how high end that will actually end up being that will be pretty high up since ive never built a computer myself you'd be in the top 3-5 tiers not 1, or 2 though you'd have to like double your spending lol yeah exceptional seems fine and then eventually i should be able to just swap out stuff that seems too slow right? or am i wrong in assuming that a computer is modular not at all, but it's unlikely you'll actually need to what i would imagine if you got all the stuff in the same tier i cant just swap out things? no, your'e not at all wrong in assuming that it is modular lol oh okay what about all the stuff in the same tier i would imagine that when one is starting to become too slow they all are around the same point of being too slow except ram, fucking 8gb of ram isn't even enough for GTA V + Chrome lol yeah so maybe you'd bump that up if you wanted a truly high end build gotta get 16 gb for that shit i mean its just two 8gb cards? or 4x4 if you want your choice eh would it be faster having more buses? 2x8 leaves the possibility of getting 32gb im not sure :simple_smile: logically it makes sense since you can parallelize calls to all 4 at the same time to get stuff in memory but it also could make it slower if it could do batch if its like GTA i'm sure the speed stuff is marginal since GTA stuff is so huge the real issue is whether you want to leave room for another 16 gb or not i mean then i'd just be buying new cards so its the upfront cost versus when I think I want more it depends on the deals, like potentially you could find that 2x4 could be cheaper than 1x8 and it would just be up to you how you want to approach that mmm thats true do you think skylake will be that much of a bump up? what does x2 mean you can buy x2 means two of the cards 2 gfx cards? yeah if your mobo has two pci-e lanes/slots/whatever they call it you can have two gfx cards and then bridge them through a connector that you attach damn HDDs are so cheap yeah the SSD hype is real although why do you need actual HDDs when you can just use external ones anyway with usb 3.0 externals are slower i think? i doubt the speed is that much slower the limiting factor of external was usb2.0 but with 3.0, i think when I was writing stuff to my hdd on my laptop my laptop hdd was the limiting factor cause I wrote stuff to an ssd at a faster rate with the same external well i'm not sure about your case but i would imagine SATA straight to your mother board is faster there's this thing i found that's kinda related i guess USB 3 is a lot slower hmm you're talking about transferring out of your computer ? well those benchmarks were for reading from those drives ohh okay but what im saying is well i guess this is only for bulk reads but usb 3 can theoretically support up to 600 megabytes / s yeah, the spec for usb 3 says up to 5 gigabits/sec SATA on your mobo is anywhere from 5-6 i see but this is all theoretical speeds yeah thats true most of the time your hdd one of the posters in that thread said that a lot of the times USB 3 is still shit lol wont be at that anyway yeah that too unless you're doing huge bulk reads like usb 3 isn't actually anywhere near it's supposed theoretical limit like letting someone else use your pirated GoT and hdds barely go past like 2-3 so both options are shit :simple_smile: hahaha so basically if usb 3 like if most hardwarre actually does usb 3 speeds even on avg it'll be fast enough for hdds it would be p fast, yeah thats what I was thinking logically although i wonder if external hdds have any build quality issues depends on if you get one of those pocket ones versus like maybe it would be bad to have that drive be spinning all the time vs a real hdd the real tower ones true yeah although i think whenever i use most of my data for like storing media it'll be on a pocket external what do I really need more than 240 gbs for prolly only games. btw, do you know if thomas ended up buying civ beyond earth? i doubt it lol we barely even play civ 5 which we should sometime :simple_smile: well games would take a lot of the 240 and then the OS will also take a decent amount but you should have stuff left over regardless isn't OS gonna bel ike 30-40 gigs? hasn't windows gotten better with it? or is it less now well, the 240 will probably be like 235 or less after you format it the way you need, i think? and then the OS is around that size i think? and then shit like GTA V is 60 fucking gigs lol mm thats true well idk, i guess it depends on what you would actually have installed do you think GTA V needs to be on an ssd though maybe you want VS Ultimate :simple_smile: most of it should go to ram anyway if they're smart about loading things you should just get 64 gb of ram and install GTA V to ram op those instant load times :^) 8) maybe toss it all into your cache that would be aight too :simple_smile: nice 64GB L1 cache 64GB L1 cache 1TB L2 cache 1 PB L3 cache wow \inf L1293 cache you guys are too cool. nah i mean a 1TB drive is $50 should probably just have one l0l although idk i guess if you use your computer a certain way, maybe you wouldn't need it i just can't really see using my computer without it's HDD to be anything other than a hassle maybe i should just have a NAS :simple_smile: right :simple_smile: totes whats a NAS network accessed storage? network attached* damn so close. why not dropbox :simple_smile: sheeeeeeeeeet my dank 10 GB network drive :simple_smile: but anyways is it possible for your network drive whats the hard limit on ethernet what do you mean? like whats the throughput max throughput prob like 10Gbips Gbps* so it could actually be faster in theory* lel xD which is always the problem like maybe your cat6 is actually cat0.1 well, you can actually reach 10Gbps speeds with a cat0.1 cable? :simple_smile: no you need 10Gbe cable kek with a coathanger? :)) actually i guess cat6 can do 10Gbps just use fiber and get a 4.3Tbps router or jk, 30Tbps why not get a carrier pidgeon to bring you flash drives from your cabinet of flashdrives :arista: :arista: :arista: :arista: :arista: :arista: just setup your own datacenter as your NAS :^) 8) why do we even have our own PCs why aren't we just all using AWS instances? and installing GTA V on those? :simple_smile: why not just drive a truckload of HDDs across the united states throughput is SO much higher :simple_smile: yeah, that's true apparently they do that like ship a briefcase of HDDs hahaha yeah i wasn't kidding we learned about that in networking ye also it is probably more resistant to MITM attacks :simple_smile: i guess arguably someone could just steal that briefcase though lel xD but how will they get the data?/ through torture? waterboarding is legal :simple_smile: oh, you mean it's encrypted? i guess that would be an issue kek yeah, the classic wrench will work prob well nah dude you go ahead and cryptolocker depends on who's moving the data the encrypted stuff lelllllll then you tell them to give you the encryption key so you uncryptolocker it :simple_smile: nice i'm the dankest hacker in the world :simple_smile: gary let's write our own cryptolocker i mean the hdd should be encrypted why would you send data IN a hdd without it being encrypted???? wtf kind of security guy are you gary a gov't security guy that's why goddamn grooby he's incompetent fucking grobble goo i just assumed that all HDDs are encrypted if you're not using it for personal use maybe they just assume it'll be safe HDDs aren't automatically encrypted i'm pretty sure maybe you're just a POS infosec guy and we should tell :lincoln_lab: about that huh? what do you think? they already know that i only work on point of sales systems :^) 8) :simple_smile: you work on the ipads that people use :square: on? and the people who run those stores need small business loans from :enova: or :avant:? actually :avant: doesn't do small business yeah who works at avant? no one they're just :enova:'s competitor nice whose CEO is :enova:'s old founder lel xD nice thomas is applying there for business data analyst stuff per my recommendation :O :O :O hopefully he can get it and then it'll be a br0 time in Chitown ye build is so slow :disappointed: gary will you slack with us when you start working? :simple_smile: idk probably not the monitoring to too rel maybe i'll be on slack on my phone i guess lol wtf do you mean by monitoring and omg i almost had a fucking stupid moment today is bring your kids to work day and they served chicken tenders only for the kids i was about to complain to my coworkers that i couldnt get my tendies. i thankfully never said that word out loud can't reveal the dank memer inside you btw why do you need to go to :enova: should've said tendies and taken some and pull out your GBPs and by monitoring, i mean the lab monitoring network traffic reading these dank messages ... that sounds sketch how? every company monitors how do they monitor i mean you use their network for https stuff i'm sure they log the network traffic isn't it encrypted at the browser level? install SSL cert that's trusted i mean oh i see you mean that idk if square does that you talk to your own networks certs but they did at sandia and then it talks to the other service for you like and thats how it monitors? sandia has everyone install their own cert so then sandia can decrypt everyone's traffic oh. we might do that idk yeah they gave us our laptops so especially if you get your laptop from them yeah they might've installed their cert yeah but why would they look at our dank memes why would they care i mean they probably don't but in the case that they do i don't want to get into trouble lel xD since i feel a national lab might be more anal about that compared to a tech company so better safe than sorry imo you guys are so lucky working for cool tech companies ...... i work for a financial institution not that cool #finance We can be crazy but not in any traceable way the feds can find you're not going to get in trouble for dank memes unless you're trying to crash the pepe market and make money off of it by shorting all your pepes wtf is a pepe /giphy pepe /giphy pepe too hard /giphy sad frog there we go the sad frog OP LOL fuckin sad frog lol why dont you just google the image and then paste it it still auto expands because i wanted to find a dank gif for u 4 uuuu /giphy bane for you nice the bane rap oh my god i love that video Yo we gotta get on the emerging Pepe markets And trade in CNY whats CNY?? WE DONT USE GBP ANYMORE?? I'm in class guys Feels weird why im at work feels weird Jesus man it's like 80 percent of the people can't fucking speak proper English Yet another student presentation where the Engrish is so rel how many international students do you guys have? It's a grad class so a lot wow too cool taking grad classes 2 gud 4 us It's like we're in New Asia New Industan? wat dat what's the -- for after the colon in your name? so if there's a sql query that's like `insert into table value ('asdf', 'asdf', 'VAR'); more sql shit` if you put my name into the VAR `insert into table value ('asdf', 'asdf', '');DROP TABLE user;--'); more sql shit` it closes out the previous sql statement adds in another sql statement, the `DROP TABLE user;` part and then comments out the rest oh so the -- is just comments? yeah SO COOL KEVIN SHU THE DB MASTER SQL MASTER! xD would it work if you didn't comment out the rest? why not i'm not sure? --'); DROP TABLE user; -- comment out your own attack :^) 8) you definitely don't want it in front noiceusuuuuu I think it would still work if you don't have the comment dang the best way to defend against sql injections is to name your tables something different like is to sanitize inputs?? userz noicesuuuuu Or... just use prepared statements?? can't get dropped no userz paym3ntzz then they'll just do a `select * from dbo.tables`? i forget the queries you run to find out what tables you have in your db at least it'll be enough to stop script kiddies like droptableuserz but we're script kiddies mang :^) 8) ruby = scripting language :disappointed: :lincoln_lab: ]': sorry you're a script kiddie it's okay ruby is written in C sheet so it's like you're writing C I thought it was just we're low level OS programmers xD SHOW TABLES in db_name; and you can get the db_name i think it just depends on what db you're using with another command lol idk it's stupid it's something that you figure out with a quick google anyways lol yeah stack overflow: `select * from information_schema.tables` i was close! nah man PGSQL is uninjectable:^) 8) yeah i think the whole `dbo` shit was from SQL Server jason, you mean `pg`? :simple_smile: postgres? why even have databases let's just have spreadsheets that way we can store our "db" snapshots through dropbox's versioning :simple_smile: :simple_smile: fuck i gotta go back and sanitize all my db inputs zz Wowowowow That's like Basic knowledge just gotta recheck everything lol wat apparently ActiveRecord#find has some vulnerabilities like what? yeahl ike what we use it all the time so im curious maybe it's like `Model.find("');DROP TABLE user;--")` :simple_smile: and then it drops the `user` table :simple_smile: .... thats the stupidest thing I've ever heard :simple_smile: find only checks for primary keys dumdum i know :disappointed: :disappointed: :((( why you trying to act so dum :disappointed: It's not an act i knew someone would say that lelaroons i was going to say it but i wanted to let novi take the glory :simple_smile: hahaha kelvin, you use RubyMine right? yah but i don't do specs and stuff in it all command line do you use tmux? ok I think we're good BLOPs 3 trailer :^) 8) time for some mlg no scope /giphy mlg :simple_smile: /giphy 360 no scope nope but i feel like i should get into tmux tmux and vim why you ask just curious i feel like i should stop being a scrub and opening multiple iterm tabs lel xD lol i have so many iterm tabs i just feel like a scrub when i have tabs instead of different tmux windows D^: you could also open multiple windows in one iterm session yeah i tried that before but it looks fugly imo lol why would tmux be any different i dont get it or are you saying you can more easily resize the windows no i'm saying that having iterm doing the split panes is ugly because of the bars and shit it's adding all over the place and then the grayed out panels for ones that are inactive stuff like that whats so different about tmux it also has the bars and stuff it looks more like it belongs in a terminal and how often are you ACTUALLY in the console? imo always lol oh you use vim? yep WOW SO OLD SCHOOL OLD SCHOOL COOL xDDDDDDDDD do you use ctags i cant do vim without ctags nope, i should probably use it though .... how do you auto complete i don't really like autocomplete when coding tbh maybe i'll try it and see if i like autocompleting mm actually i dont like autocomplete that much either but what i do like is being able to go go to something calling a function hitting a hot key yeah that's nice and going to the function definition like seeing other people do it in sublime its just so ugh they have to find all type in lol i have to do it all ghetto like right now yeah i have to do that def 'function_name' blahblah and if its defined in multiple namespaces `:Ag def something` it doesn't find the right onw its just gay i assume Ag is like all grep grep through all files? well it is greping i think you know ack? it's just a better version of that and there's a plugin you can install in vim for ack or for ag and you can just `:Ack` or `:Ag` and search right there inside vim and then it'll open up a horizontal split and show you the results from which you can just open up the file and go straight to the result mm yeah but still it seems very annoying yeah it def wouldn't be as easy as putting the cursor over the function call and just hitting a shortcut but for the time being it's at least better than how fucking sublime does it lol using the mouse ugh oh yeah you have to click it in sublime lol yeah I don't use my mouse like 90% of the time I'm in ruby mine Beer da bess Bier? Beeeeeeeeer did you actually type that kevin? or are you a poser and just used google translate i'm just a poser :disappointed: yar from the german styled pub at berkeley bekommen richtig betrunken Buddy jah never sushi delivery noooope Where's the German pub in Berkeley?

IT related shit and him goofing off all the tiem nice the interview candidate that just walked out of the interview room has a turban on hire him #sikhlyfeXD i'll make sure to ask him if he knows a Chadeep Autisinghism :simple_smile: why didn't you interview him? and ask him what it means to be a true Novdip? what if his name is navdeep laeeemooooaaooaoaoaoo fuck you novi why do you have a name that makes me have to think for a sec whether that's actually your name :disappointed: wtf novi, navu, novidep, navdeep, novdip wow you're actually that dumb what's the fucking difference :^) 8) novideep navdeepdishpizza i mean they're all the fucking same it's basically the difference between rope and rape :simple_smile: exactly no difference :simple_smile: Gary and Shil left me alone in the apartment while they left to do shit I'm sitting around in my underwear feels good man you're a fucking dank memer 4 sure i'm clearly a vim scrub i never new that `gg=G` reindents your whole file that's OP wow so bad just switch to rubymine i'm sorry kelvin senpai why not switch tho? i just prefer vim :confused: what like what do you prefer about vim well, one everyone else uses vim so there's some peer pressure and if not vim, sublime or atom or emacs no one uses an IDE .... why does peer pressure matter at all with these things im just wondering why you prefer vim modal editing hyppppppe also the plugins make it pretty swanky rubymine has it? stfu rubymine has most things that vim has xDDDDDD i would not use rubymine without the vim plugin is the vim plugin actually good? sublime's vim mode kinda blew it does what i need so what do you use in the vim mode? i mostly use the editing visual block visual line yanking G and gg i guess sublime largely left a bad impression on me what was so bad about the sublime one ive never really used sublime it didn't work right lol like the expected behavior of wut ddj didn't do what i thought it would or something like that doesnt it just delete the line and then you move one line donw sorry no, i meant dj but regardless, i don't think it was that what do you expect it to do it was something else where it wasn't deleting/yanking the right amount of lines or something like i always use visual line for deleting/yanking lines and thats never fucked up lol if you pasted a yank, it would paste it one the line of your cursor and not the line after on* i use visual line if the selection is more than two lnies lines* but if it's just one `dd` or if it's two `dj` instead of `shift+v d` or `shift+v j d` :simple_smile: well rubymine vim plugin does the right thing for all of those cases. so how do you navigate to other files in your directory? i use the built in rubymine searches i search for a file name not search sorry but like you just type file names and it'll populate or classes Class is better how do you bring up that search? cause theres less of them cmd + shift + n for file cmd + n for class thats not a vim thing thats a rubymine thing yah if vim didn't have plugins i would, but with ctrl-p i kinda get that anyways ctrl-p to fuzzy search files enter to open whats fuzzy search do you mean find i guess it works the same way they just call it fuzzy search like is it where you type in the file name yeah i see and if i get ctags going to definitions and stuff would be nice, too yeah but the annoying thing about ctags is rerunning it every so often i just always used vim and don't really want to change is probably the biggest reason i like it and i see no reason to change ive always used vim at school but i see no reason not to use an ide if it provides the same functionality + more what about when you refactor code what do you do what about code generation i guess that ends up being more manual what code generation though? like `rails g controller`? no nvm thats prolly more java like getters and setters and stuff like that yeah i wouldn't use vim for something like that if you're talking about doing stuff like java etc like refactoring and renaming a class is great in rubymine because it searches its indices and finds all of it and renames it to the right thing for you yeah refactoring is definitely a huge plus for IDEs are you doing that a lot, though? like refactorings that go across multiple files all over the project not a lot like maybe once a week or when its the early stage i use one name dont like it and change it around a couple of times it basically makes it a lot less likely for you to forget about something yeah, refactoring in vim is definitely a lot hackier if you want to automate it otherwise it's manual im sure its doable and then maybe you forget to make changes somewhere if you also use ctags yeah the nice thing about rubymine is that it lets you preview also the file masking is nice for searches also search only in this path i do have to use my mouse when I do that though. yay for oncall tickets `JP - unable to create a new account with domain name '@dearest.memorial'` fucking ridiculous preview? meaning it'll open like a preview window of where you'd end up if you follow the search results? and not open it in the window that you're working in? well dearest.memorial is actually a domain doesn't below to anyone though it seems it's just parked lol nono like it previews what you're going to change i know but the tickets that I have to deal with are real you just h8n h8n on yeah we just haven't updated our email_validation kevin have you started drinking yet I'm farting in your bed it's smelly novi is going to turn me into a drunkard np i'm holding on are you in chitown?

come work at :ctc: and we can go out to lunch together erry day honestly though that is a lot of money over the course of a year thats like unheard of for me most people here bring their stuff to and from i'm def not the norm lol did you make it to your meeting yeah ofc zzz i woke up at 8:30 just naturally lol shet so fucking tired i woke up at 8:30 naturally too then i saw the time and im like fuck this going back to sleep and slept yeah same, but couldn't really fall asleep again :simple_smile: i should start staying past 6/7 and getting free dinners :simple_smile: herro wow kevin your work life is so chill i work from 10:30 to like 8 everyday and sometimes i do work at home yeah, i'm not going to lie, it really is super chill since I don't think ive done enough but i mean you work more you get paid more right?? do you get overtime kelvin? obv no :disappointed: nope salaried worker man such is life mang is your bonus based on performance or is it similar to everyone else's how much variability is there on that? bonus? whats a bonus rekt no bonus at :square: but it's oka okay* no bonus at :lincoln_lab: y'all gettin' robbed :disappointed: i'm sure kelvin gets a bonus feel like most tech companies would it would make sense Kelvin can you confirm you'll be gettin' a fatty check at Christmastime and buying us all games? no... we don't get bonuses i don't think it's how it works at most tech companies they get upfront bonuses our "bonuses" is our stock oh lel xD "yearly bonuses" and "performance review bonuses" are probably not Agile enough for them :simple_smile: i honestly don't think many tech companies have bonuses wow guess :ctc: is not agile or at least pre ipo tech companies it makes no sense when most of them are bleeding money you'd enjoy the last episode of silicon valley I watched some nig nog was like "lel revenue is not the goal of a company it's to be valuable" xD "we need to be losing money to be worth more" kevin are you expecting to get a bonus at christmas? i already know i'm getting one it's part of my contract oh wat so you got a signing and a christmas bonus? damn i mean the bonus is in feb but i suppose that's how it works for most companies the bonus is also typically split into two parts too rich for my blood your bonuses are also like i mean honestly i don't think i'm doing badly for money or anything 50% of your salary right? but certainly not rich not me that's like Shil fucking finance negroids wtf no lol for shil it will be for me it's variable more than 50% for shil maybe but typically like 10-20% of my salary ah but you also get stock? nope :disappointed: ohhhhh okay. that's not how it works in finance companies yah technically the thing is though your bonus structure changes over time my "bonus" is my stock as you get higher up you tend to get more bonus so right now if we don't change kelvin's "bonus" is potentially worthless :disappointed: and we ipo at our current price my "stock bonus" is worth 75% of my salary lol is your current price something you can tell us without getting the SEC on your ass? pretty noice but it could also be potentially worth zero so.. .yah I'm pretty sure it won't be worth zero you can find it online our valuation is 6 bil def not worth 0 lel xD see the problem here is that if i leave i will need to buy my options so your "bonus" is 75% but that's it? like there's no way it's 75%/year right? lol assuming current price stays that way some companies give yearly stock bonuses but I think in the case of pre ipo companies it's one big amount up front and then a bit more every year but 75% of kelvin's salary is a lot of stock to be giving away wait lol what? im confused what're you asking so basically your 75% bonus is a one-time thing? no its every year for the next 4 years oh sheet i think he meant the amount he got is worth 75% of his salary now not that they give him 75% worth that's a pretty good deal its great its the most any company gave me part of the reason im here although, if after their most recent evaluation kelvin in for the long con the stock bonus value is the same. /giphy scam artist so pretty much since pinterest doubled their stock offer is now the same as my square offer lel xD nice lol fuck pinterest man you don't wanna be a hippy girl you guys are so cool with your bonuses you made the right choiuce *choice i'm just going to be poor and homeless i make the least out of everyone :disappointed: but i probably also do the least dont fuck lel xD my cost of living salary is the lowest out of everyone :simple_smile: lol i mean technically that's true lol and im not seeing yeah, fuck you kevin my "stock bonus" until maybe you're rolling in dough 3 years from now no i'm not i'm poor af if we end up ipoing 2 years from now LOL theres a 1 year lock on my stock if we do end up ipoing every company does that yeh but then you get tons of $$$$$$$$$$ well hopefully Mr Dorsey doesn't see that your future is tossed out the window as Gary says it's the long con unless square stock gets rekt and takes care of y'all @ :square: :disappointed: then it's the long rekt that would be quite sad yeah hopefully it doesn't happen i'm the real scammer hm? have 2 year signing bonus you're taking our money literally gary leave after 2.5 years kek you fucking fucker YOU'RE LITERALLY TAKING MY MONEY YOU'RE LITERALLY FUCKING MY TAX DOLLARS yeah so buy me CSGO let's just not pay taxes and fuck gary yeah lel xD XD let's all become Chinese spies wait so gary loses his clearance gary whats your thing like im curious how different it is for gov jobs what do you mean? total comp structure pretty much like base salary and traditional benefits i got a pretty nice signing bonus though that's not normal i think though so pretty much gary wang fucking scammed the shit out of US Taxpayers decent matching for 401k though and :lincoln_lab: still has pension idk if i'll do that though wtf US taxpayers are paying this guy to fucking dick around on his ass all day YOU HAVE A PENSION i mean thats not fuckin fair they offer it :((( idk if i'll do it do it whyt why take more of my money why don't you i think i would need to work like 10 years there why would you not want a pension TAKE MORE OF MY FUCKING MONEY YOU ALREADY TAKE ALL MY TIME so AND DEDICATION dude if you have a pension JUST FUCKING TAKE MONEY FROM MY NON-EXISTENT PENSION you'll be living comfortably goddammit but i could probably make more while we slave awaay for the penis you have to work for the government and then save more until we are like 70 years ol *pension if i work elsewhere nah, kelvin is gonna strike it rich lol :square: is going to 10x price if we actually 10x i would be a paper millionaire nice lmao *multimillionaire just gotta hope it doesn't crash then then you could drop fat stacks at the club :square: will 10x for 364 days every boi's dream then on day 365 -10x :simple_smile: what if that happens lol what because all the square employees cash out its possible. but first to get to that step we have to IPO lolol nice if you guys IPO will :square: still give you your yearly stock? what do you mean its in my contract oh, nice yeah, i was wondering if there was some bs where they won't give you any more stock if they IPO during those 4 years if they IPO then the stock they give will be worth less because it'll be x amount of stock at a locked in price so he'd get less stock right? yeah, is it in shares, or in $ value? wat no if it's some quantity of shares, then it might scale well i have number in shares yeah, that's what i thought wtf im not stupid lel xD if they give me some $ price then itll never increase theres no incentive whew, that's good kelvin's going to become super mega rich lol my career destination survey got here should i say that I earn 170MM as a starting power forward in the :nba: yeah do it fuck berkeley, amirite?

i'm seeing like $92 yeah imo just dorp the that's prob what we have to pay just drop the $100 yeah just drop the m$$$ i don't mind just think about how much i paid for it but gary gave me the ultimatum of $75 and feel happy :simple_smile: :disappointed: gary literally pointed a fucking loaded gun at my head and forced me to find tickets with obstructed and limited view for cheap amirite ? i don't actually care i'll drop $100 ok its good we could also sit on mezzanie center general butt naked :simple_smile: is that too far? why don't we go all phantom of the opera and hide in the rafters? we can abduct some pretty girls later novi's favorite activity let's sit front row lower balcony it's not a fulfilling night for novi unless there's some sort of abduction/b&amp;e/vandalism/obstruction of justice/puking/xD wait nice i think the $92 includes the suite service so it's worth lel xD free dranksSSSSSssS :simple_smile: suite service? oh is that what it is or cheap dranks i mean or free? i forget wtf is suite service it says open bar i think it was free i think what the fuck nice I wanna get liquored up noiceeeee WHAT let's go get FUKT UP THATS NOT FUCKIN FAIR kelvin gettin rekt again lel xD yeah BOA THEATRE OP like mezzanie level center like 3rd row it's like 108 with suite service on 5/12 theres no way its an open bar An additional $35.00 (plus fees) per person charge provides a suite package including access to private suite 45 minutes prior to show time and at intermission, with complimentary light hors d'oeurves, full service bar, restrooms, coat check and more. damn, maybe not open bar no it was some coworkers told me that it was like that yeah i thought at the selection screen it says it was but then hmm oh wait maybe the complimentary applies to all those things in the list and it just wasn't clear Package Includes: Priority Seat Location, access to private suite 45 minutes prior to show and during intermission with open bar, light snacks, private restrooms and coat check as part of your VIP Treatment. The VIP Suite Service is an additional $35 (plus applicable fees). Total Package price will be shown at the end of the transaction sounds like its only before but still really nice but dont drink too much anyways it would be $92+$35 i think :simple_smile: not $92 includes the $35 you should drink enough to enjoy laughing you should spoil it for yourself and listen to it on spotify! gr8 plan! im listening to it right now Suite Package Includes: Priority Seat Location, access to private suite 45 minutes prior to show and during intermission with open bar, light snacks, private restrooms and coat check as part of your VIP Treatment. The VIP Suite Service is an additional $35 (plus applicable fees). Total Package price will be shown at the end of the transaction really? so i think i went to checkout and it was like included its stil 184? damn in the $108 dude oh shit dats nice dats a steal idk i didn't get any free drinks or h'or deurves we can just try to buy them i guess but yeah maybe it's not included no matter what you have me beat :simple_smile: just think about that it's not it's not included i just asked my coworker regardless though he tells me that suite service is totes worth it not only just for the alcohol but for the special bathroom area so you don't get fucking destroyed by lines hm, okay guess we can just pay for it so it'll be like $150ish? i guess? i mean i don't mind either way and yeah wait what so idk i mean why are you guys so baller i don't think you need the suite on the one hand it's $150 for slightly worse seats + suite access and on the other it's $150 for OP seats but no suite it's not $150 for OP seats we can get pretty good seats for $108 i'm looking at lower balcony first row you can get like back of lower balcony for $108 yeah but that's the back of the lower balcony lol yeah, i guess but is it that much of a differenc? idk or sorry i mean mezzanine first row get the OP seats we can always flask it I have enough for all of us hue hue hue hm i don't really care i probably wouldn't take advantage of free alcohol though but those snacks doe and no bathroom line are dece i suppose and i guess i can still get free soda lel xD please gary have 1 drink with me :disappointed: it tastes so shit though mAN THE FUCK UP idk i honestly think it'll always taste like shit if you never drink any of it i guess we can drink champagne i think i could tolerate that do i look like a white chick to you? ... ;^) gary what have you drank pls thats important nothing pretty much nothing he's a fucker see? he's a fucking fuccboi ... no like actually what have you drank like actually literally almost why do you think it tatstes like shit nothing pretty much nothing tastes ... so how do you know y'all need to try licking spilled whiskey off of a girl's tits it's not bad it tastes like shit the salt from the skin adds extra flavor i've taken a couple sips of beer/wine and it just was shit couldn't do it i had a glass of wine and had a hard time finishing it and my gf said it was a pretty sweet wine and not like sour and i still had trouble getting through that so yeah fuck alcohol man, you'll get used to the flavo once you drink enough and realize it makes life feel really good it turns mediocre movies into laugh fests it turns sad moments into ones that have a blunt edge it turns otherwise prude chicks into raging sluts alcohol makes the world turn it seems like there might be more seats on 5/13 i'm busy 5/13 what could you be busy with????????????????????????????? but okay /giphy jerking off what novi said before why aren't you doing that on 5/12???????????????????????????????? licking spilt whiskey off of a girl's teat attaboi i think i would prob pref just the teat though novi can you find me some hunnies? i'm bad at meeting people I believe I can arrange that just come out to me not to shitty dive bars that you'll get *hate but to some quieter cocktail loungers *lounges but what if i don't want to just fuck someone :disappointed: yeah quieter cocktail lounges a few good drinks loosens people up and lets you get to know them better great environment for talking am i a faggot for wanting to actually know someone better before any extra curriculars? :confused: like actually know them the fuck do you mean extra curriculars? instead of their ostensible interests ???? fucking lel xD I'm confused do you mean you'd rather not go out for drinks with me and some girls before getting to actually know the girls? no then what do you mean? you'd rather get to know them before you bang? if so that's k ya and perfectly normal i feel like Chads don't do that :disappointed: what if i just wanna be a Chad? what if i just wanna be like Chadeep Ausinghism? what the fuck is going on i talk to my coworker for mins being Chad is not about banging girls and i read this shit it's about having the confidence to do what you actually want to do and about having the option to bang a chick even if you'd rather not #deep #edgy I personally prefer getting to know chicks before banging them it makes it a lot better everyone is more comfortable and the emotional attachment makes every thrust that much better am a lesser man in your eyes now ???? you weren't a man in his eyes to begin with #bleedingedge rekterino hahaha try cocktails it'll be a lot easier to drink or jungle juice lel xD for realz, some of them go down pretty easy just pretend you're a girl gary but I'd recommend non whiskey cocktails for you Gary those tend to have more biet *bite what do you mean pretend? :^) 8) yeah, idk, i guess i'll try them if they're free cheapskate or i mean wait but whiskey drinks taste amazing i pay for the suite shit might as well get something anyways get something like a moscow mule ezpz to drink or a cosmo I know whiskey drinks are amazing but Gary might not like them omg don't tell him to order a cosmo i gotta get a cosmo that's like social bar suicide with you novi we can get them together fuck mang I'll just have some bourbon on the rocks its okay WAIT did i tell you the story or a not utterly chick cocktail of my friend's 21st birthday hm? he had a bet with a friend that he could drink $100 worth of alcohol in one night if he did the friend would pay for it so we were doing a bar crawl in palo alto he was doing fine he got to like 80 dollars then we went to the lats bar last* i'll get tix later tonight kkkk :joy: :yum: :joy: :yum: :joy: :yum: :joy: :yum: :joy: :yum: :joy: :yum: :joy: :yum: :joy: :yum: :joy: :yum: :joy: :yum: :joy: :yum: :joy: :yum: :joy: :yum: :joy: :yum: :joy: :yum: :joy: :yum: i ordered a manhattan and he ordered some random shit but he was blacked out at this point he already told the bartender that he likes girly drinks and he finished his first one really quickly he slurred to the bartender get me whatever I was having (what I was having) a manhattan and he was like sure thing he brought out a cosmo and he didn't notice and drank it and said best manhattan hes ever had then he threw up a little on the table LOLOLOLOL walked out of hte bar 10/10 and threw up ALLL over the sidewalk nice so did he reach 100? i have a picture of him sleeping in the car no he got to 90 rekt rekt with a paper bag over his head because we were afraid of him just puking in the car anyways we went back the next week and the bartender called him cosmo rekt oh geez and then they went back 2-3 months later how would a paper bag over his head even help? and found out the bartender that did this for us #drunklogic died :disappointed: wut u surs idk *srs we asked for him specifically cause we knew his name unexpected turn in the story yeah i didn't know about it since I didn't go the last time no he was facing down and the paper bag was like in front of his face so if hep uked it would fall into the bag because gravity oh, i guess that kinda makes sense that's still kinda retarded but damn kelvin gives us a sad turn to the story that's the kind of shit they tell us not to do in risk management trainingt why bartender seemed like a bro whats wrong with a paper bag he was a bro if you put it on his head like I think you did if he puked or got snot on it the paper could get wet and go up his nose which would just make him sick also it would limit airflow which would make him more likely to puke nono the paper bag was on his lap i was sitting next to him i put his head into the paper bag oh down into oh yeah that's cool okay i was like it would all fall into the bag im not that stupid ive watched breaking bad im not walt heh nice :simple_smile: should have used a plastic bag ala work hard, play hard :simple_smile: ... thanks kevin i didn't know you were a murderer :simple_smile: best h3h3 productions video idk wake up sheeple was pretty good too it was pretty real but i still like work hard play hard the best rekt series is pretty good too work hard play hard had a pretty good monologue but i think wake up sheeple had better video or i mean yeah, i'll agree with that what he was doing on camera lol but rekt series had the best music and dancing :^) 8) wake up sheeple's music was pretty good too pretty fitting :simple_smile: wat dat dank meme videos :disappointed: idk if ur dank enuff kelvin sigh how can i be as dank as you guys fine keep it a secret i'll always be chasing you just gotta embrace the dank memes after your coattails p much yeah sigh im so hurt so its 5 pm are you gettin ready to go home kevin yeah lol actually doe i mean i need to go to the banco to take care of some stuff and they close at 6 wow too cool lel xD why don't you drink your bourbon neat? why bourbon why not scotch I like it on the rocks, it helps mellow the flavor a bit for me Also bourbon over scotch is a small personal preference Though I like both My dad and I have very similar whiskey tastes damn for me its whiskey with water i add a little bit of water to cut down on the bite Yeah common technique although some of my friends have whiskey rocks so i add that in addition to the water I heard they don't work well hmm they're okay it just makes it so it stays consistent (the water dilution) Ahh should i get a lolita ~ahn yes don't you wanna be fingering a lolita all day erry day? uhhh, i mean it seems like a decent board it's not cherry mx but a knockoff switch i think i read they're okay though might as well go for it it'll prob be better than a rubber dome if you're using one but if you're already using a mech board then it might not be better so yeah, idk really lolol the first thing i saw was novi's comment should i save for a cherry switch board? and i was like wtf I'm in no hurry save? what is saving just spend the money #yolo /giphy make it rain i mean it's up to you i hear the kailh switches are okay i would do more if you see enough people say it's good kevin what keyboard do you use at work then i would go for it $66 is pretty good for a mech board this past summer i used this shet so rich sandia bought it for me did you take it home and then i managed to get one for myself for free lol from one of my project leads no wow you're stealing government money yeah he had an old ps2 one is that treason? no, it was his but he gave it to me yeah Gary is guilty of treason this is my keyboard at work but anyways, i also have this i use that at home primarily i just got this though and have been using it anyone want to buy this off me? no why is my keyboard so nub that's not actually mine, but that's what it looks like this is mine at home just buy this nice oh yeah that's right i feel bad bringing it to work cause its so fuckin loud just give no fucks i dont work in an office like you do baylife tell them to all get mech boards and they'll thank you lol im used to using my mac keyboard and i also use my touchpad for all my mouse stuff yeah i want to get a mac laptop when i work but i also don't want to relearn the command/ctrl shit it's so stupid why can't command just literally be control? uh what i guess for me why does command not work like control in a shell? whenever i did work it was mainly with macs so im just used to the cmd key beause its still a *nix based system but then why couldn't they just make it all control then? it'll break the commands that need ctrl wat you mean like opening a new tab and what not yeah so like i honestly like cmd + t in chrome, it'll be command t better than ctrl + t i mean i remap control to caps lock easier to move thumb thanp inky oh you don't map esc? so that's why i'm annoyed u so cool i remap esc when i use a kinesis but yeah, that's why i don't like the cmd vs ctrl in mac because if i remap cmd i still have to go reach and hit ctrl in shell and that feels really weird now so much nicer to have ctrl right next to A hmmm idk either way its a bit awk to do ctrl + a that's true but that's like the only weird one even then it's just pinky plus ring finger you get used to it mhm yeah i know I'm sitting in fraternity chapter right now as we are holding elections for some positions I feel old guys lol /giphy old balls oh well, there's probably a way to remap ctrl in shell to use cmd gary and iare fucking talking about keyboard configurations yeah idgaf :^) 8) its super important well Gary is a huge keyboard fag his anal beads are just "a" keys tied together by string it is important mang gotta remap something useful to caps esc is good yeah exactly i use vim mode so its nice this is my work keyboard and hopefully this will be my work mouse in a few days lol wtf why do you need that kinda mouse it looks like a gaming mouse why not? :simple_smile: anyways fuck you guys i'm gonna go run time to work hard so i can play hard :simple_smile: kevin doing exercises? waow good name bby and why not get this mouse i want to try one of these out ew fuck man this chapter is gonna run so long jenu *neu *jesus damn just nominate yourself for a 3rd term and become frat master for life yeah let's just fail so I can do that :thumbsup: I can try for the alumni board later :simple_smile: :simple_smile: for your specific chapter?

I'm pretty sure I'd destabilize the world through actions I thought were smart but really weren't and then eventually I'd just become a recluse banging bitches but being too apathetic to try and help the world :league:? novi's a fucking nerd p-pls damn do you read the injustice series? injustice series? do you mean the gods among us injustice series? yes yeah it was pretty good they did a decent job at publicizing it too because of the game I'd say it was a pretty nice alternate universe one-shot yea it was deep some of the new 52 batman/superman comics deal with that there was one arc where both of them lost their memories and they had to choose to get them back or just do what they wanted superman became a conceited asshole and batman became a super happy go lucky playboy that used his now instinctive training to just do what he wanted damn legit in a similar vein they did an alternate universe crossover thing in the justice league animated series and there was also a movie released called crisis on two earths I'd say the justice league animated series one was better it was more mature and actually dealt with some issues that would become the main driving point behind the series plot of justice league unlimited no :league: today??? grooveshark is apparently gone they got fucked by record companies yeah i just saw that too lol tedford is coaching the BC Lions now wtf wtf is bc lions the british columbia lions?

im taking 2 weeks off june 1 to like 14 then I'm working from our NY office June 14- June 21 then flying back to sf essentially, I'll be gone from sf for 3 weeks that should be a fun 2 weeks especially NYC it's a great city haha yeah i wanted to visit it to see if i wanted to move there in a year or tow and legitimately work from there explore places like east village and the upper west/east sides walk around tribeca there's so much to see and do it's great listen to empire state of mind on repeat :^) YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS though imo Jay-Z has some really lazy lyrics in that song but Alicia Keys kills it we should all move to nyc in 2 years =^) :disappointed: shet I think I'd quite enjoy that if anything i'm buying a condo in Chicago in 2 years what the fuck you're settling down? damn whos the lucky lady i settle down for myself :^) who gets to live in your luxurious condo when i lose my job. can i live in it rent free and mooch let's get a civil union and then i get a tax break, too :^) is it legal in illinois yah i think so i think we only save on taxes if i actually am unemployed theres like a tax calculator somewhere on 538 and i put two people with my income lol and you pay more in taxes if you get married. wtf that shouldn't be the case lol try it out yourself! I'm pretty sure you need to consult an actual accountant about this they sometimes pull shit out of nowhere yeah i agree but for a rough estimate i wouldn't be too surprised if its actually pretty even before and after if you both make a like ~100k 100k is a pretty high salary we just got lucky that we're in a good field yeah, it's fantastic that we found something that we like to do that's also in one of the best markets out there but on the flip side we do deal with a lot of autism and i think the thing about tax breaks for marriage a lot of them were already single income so it makes a lot of sense to get married but more people are getting jobs and high paying ones at that are there actually more people getting high paying jobs? a big problem is that federal law doesn't really work in places like SF where the price of everything is so inflated or is that just how we see it because everyone we know does CS stuff? yeah it seems like if your combined income is there aren't really much savings well most jobs that are being offered or have a lot of positions tend to be more highly skilled work because computers are taking the jobs of lower skilled workers :disappointed: and those tend to get paid more right? the only thing i would think might be off is when you say *most* jobs idk if it's most but yeah i'm sure the jobs replacing workers are paid more is unemployment rising as a whole? well technically it isn't because a lot of people have stopped looking for jobs and gave up sheet so they're not counted in the unemployment rate yeah i remember reading about how it's counted like that lol ! google's so cool :))) ```The labor force participation rate, or the number of people who have or are seeking a job, is at 62.5 percent -- a 37-year low. Many Americans have simply given up on finding employment in the aftermath of the 2008 recession, a point Republicans make every time President Barack Obama touts signs of a surging economy. ``` yeah 3% decrease it seems like do you think thats a 1:1 like the real unemployment rate is ~8%? that's kinda what i was thinking i'm sure it's good enough at least for an estimate though yeah before the recession it was at ~4.5% damn thats a pretty huge increase still better than this lel rofl and then fucking greece is like why cant we be norway :((( what if norway just jukes the stats? :OOO 25% of norway's population is employed as "vagrant" LOL or the asian countries sk, tw, jp, cn are all at or less than 4% CN being less than 4% seems like huge bullshit lmao lel thats what the official numbers say shouldn't you back it up? you're from the red state i support ROC :^) lol look at germany wtf man they're too stronk its so weird though. there are countries where 1 in 4 people cant find a job. do you think north korea has 0% unemployment rate? probably everyone is a servant of the country :^) yeah it would be all government based qatar has .3 % unemployment everyone is a servant of allah :^) OK, well, qatar is fucking loaded as all hell is it actually? or is it like 0.001% of the people there wait it might be Kuwai *Kuwait have 99.99999% of the wealth? some middle eastern governments have so much money anyone that wants a job can get one and if you're a citizen you get paid so much $$$$$$ they basically don't have taxes because the government is fucking loaded due to oil maybe if we were white we could go there and become expats :disappointed: but we're yellow and yo're indian so it's even worse for you why cant we go there because we're not white :disappointed: why does that matter? well it's just easier to do anything if you're white they welcome white people in the middle east the asians are just seen as kinda inferior indians are just the bottom of the barrel, right? lol in the middle east yeah because most of the physical and shit labor force is made up of poor indians whereas the citizens of the country don't have to do shit because of oil so they think they're hot shit because their region has natural resources and because Indians go everywhere looking for work due to population issues ohhh okay i didn't know that we're the wrong color kelvin :disappointed: dammit on the flip side in Indian middle easterners and Pakistanis are seen as fanatical assholes lel even though pakistan is india :^) not really anymore man at least economically speaking asian men get #rekt :disappointed: except they're the greenest when rated by asian women :simple_smile: so i guess that's the only one that matters :simple_smile: eh, can't let being asian hold you back it just makes conquering white women and latinas that much more satisfying i mean obviuosly this is all jokes :^) let's be black and try to get asian chicks play life on hard mode or even worse let's be black women and try to get any guy other than a black guy lmao man being black would suck lel except for getting into college or for getting a job really? getting a job? i wouldn't think being black helps that much idk man being a minority in CS helps a lot and by minority I mean non male, Asian, or white eh maybe i think being black but i don't think do the extent definitely helps tho everyone is doing that it would for college these diversity programs i think it really depends on the company too though if its like a really small company they prolly don't give a fuck but if its like a large company who needs to hit "diversity quotas" it would prolly help you and im fairly certain do companies even have diversity quotas? some companies do have "diversity quotas" seems like lip service they kinda do even if they're unspoken they want to be to actual diversity able to have a graph that shows LOOK we have this kind of diversity in our employees it's a publicity boon and a legal defense look specifically at tech lol cisco has so much other! :^) rofl fucking linkedin 2manyAZNs OK one thing are these graphs including HR or are they just engineering? that's why kelvin said look at specifically tech there's a specific breakdown for tech yeh :simple_smile: scroll down yeah that's about right just looked look also at diversity in tech not just gender, but also by race asians are way overrepresented let's all work at ebay :^) ebay is a relative poonfest my dad works at ebay lel but hes going to be working at paypal soon as in when the company splits shieeeet why don't they show the numbers for like etsy etsy is still prolly mostly dudes hmm what do you think might have close to a 50:50 i thought pinterest at first but was surprised to see ebay pinterest in that aspect i doubt anything is really close to 50:50 and anything that comes close is probably too small to be significant let's make a 50:50 startup :^) ok okay in nyc? you'd get sued regarding that to get a 50-50 startup NYC is 2 $$$ we gotta keep it cheap in CHI you'd have to discriminate based on sex while hiring but thats where the women are at if you look at percentage of each side fuck i just love novi's choice of diction is a relative poonfest i :heart: u nivdap I :heart: u 2 we can just hiring freeze lmfao whenever we don't get enough female applicants and keep our policies to ourselves :^) or we can specifically have titles "Female SDE 1" "Male SDE 1" !!! profit rofl i mean certainly to some extent you're allowed to discriminate, right? i mean what's stopping novi from applying to be a stripper at Silver Bullet then? theres nothing that falls under modeling that stops him which has specific laws alright we're a modeling company there are different classes of positions what is silver bullet and our models program on the side silver bullet is a strip club in Champaign okay we can be an escort company lolol fucking navdoop yea that also does software !!! silver bullet is in urbana oh mb damn shitter rekt how often do you guys frequent that fine establishment 0 errday :disappointed: novi meets engineering chicas there since kevin can't go to the strip clubs in GTA black ones :^) ]': :disappointed: lol the one time i almost went to one Press `E` to Make It Rain someone ended up going to the hospital instead. lmfao what happened? RIP Kevin's R* account 2015-2015 im sure you've heard this story it was like 2 or 3 yeras ago years* was this with jay yah I vaguely remember this essentially i'll give the gist he played a game of BP against someone. betting that if he lost we would all go to a strip club the rest of us were like, we'd go with jay went for w/e reason he ended up losing the game of BP after he was up like 1-5 lol so his next decision was to get as drunk as he could before going so he wouldn't remember it. he got me to play shot pong with him i think we played a best of 7 and i won 4-3 but he "felt sorry for me" whenever i lost the round so he ended up taking a shot every round and then i think he drank some more and then he was like lets gather up people to go to the strip club and after he was playing with a knife outside and was just throwing it on the ground and we were like fuck. thats not okay and so we brought him home and forced him to sleep apparently he kept throwing up at night in his bed so they called the paramedics and he was at the hospital for alcohol poisoning i was pretty drunk. so i slept through the entire thing of firefighters / paramedics coming in lol i woke up and saw a text from him saying. wtf why am i in the hospital i went to his room saw he was in his bed at like 7 am. and went back to sleep thought he was just dreaming lol. i was so wrong i bet novi reads this and is just like "eh, just another tuesday at KDR" :^) well i hope people don't end up at the hospital... i felt bad though. i enabled him by playing shot pong with him lol woah yea dang lets move to sioux county alameda is terrible we were fucked to begin wth with it's looking at children from poor families but alameda sucks across the board lel i mean just click on the top right im prolly considered 75th percentile and alameda is -1140 yea that's why we should move to sioux or obrien county whars that how much does a family have to make to be considered top 1% like 500k? both in iowa i think obrien is the best for the 1%ers at like +8k what if you were a boy in westchester county in ny in the top 1% you're fuckin op ooomg dude new york hype it's happening time to move there its for my kids where's when you need him ]': what oh I'm just looking at keyboards ]': there's too many to choose from yeah the offerings have really expanded gary is so cool being the sole gatekeeper of keyboards where were you when i bought my daskeyboard :disappointed: i was still a keyboard noob back then :disappointed: back then there were also less offerings though so my dasKeyboard is shit now? should i buy a new one I'm looking at the CM storm but the type makes my eyes bleed do any american retailers sell filcos?

Of doing financial services Idk not just hard sciences but actually like learning from industry professionals instead of trying to build their own ideas from scratch I feel like the founders of most startups would be much better off if they worked in their fields for other companies for a years hrm i don't know about that I think that the "freshness" of some people going into the industry is what makes it more exciting if you work in fields in other companies you'll probably start thinking in that format. maybe you won't. but its harder to break from the mold that mouse kelvin, are Mission burritos garbage? :^) El Farolito SoCal Mexican food :^) US Mexico whats wrong with mission burritos i like mission burritos i actually don't like a lot of socal mexican food its literally a wrap, with bean rice cheese and meat theres no guac or pico de gallo no lettuce its hard to eat imo maybe it's more authentic that way \_()_/ also no fries Yay Ayyy what i thought only san diego burrito had fries in it Oh I got them mixed up nvm yeah those are california burritos mang get yo shit together california worst mexican food :^) I love how the bros with jobs are the most active participants in the channel during the day what else do we do during the day but talk to bros idk Work?

i'm basically the paragon of level-headedness :simple_smile: m much yea, to run anything on a national level you gotta be above the results are fun :simple_smile: Jason being all leftist and libertarian Kevin being all centrist and slightly libertarian tfw no one i sright *is right fuck i'll do it when i get home hm I thought I'd be less libertarian im curious I was in favor of a lot of market regulation what should i be idk being socially liberal is enough to make you ron paul there were a lot of subtle questions regarding libertarianism you probably were for corporations doing whatever the fuck Kelvin just take the quiz at work it takes like 5-10 min I guess I misread the questions aight i'll take it in like 20-30 mins i got some stuff to do because wanted corporate regulation on stuff like environmental dmage lol you could take it again if you're not sure about your result hm nah too long i feel like it doesn't make sense to take it again cause you already have some prior knowledge idk if that matters i mean as long as you don't change your answers because you changed your mind or something assuming that you didn' *didn't misread questions ^correct but if you change your answer because you misunderstood something yeah hm ahh i see lel should i go to a lan in berkeley to play csgo instead of going to the gym #nerd fuk u kevin so mean to me what did i ever do to you :disappointed: so centrist what there's a CS go lan?

I have no idea how FC rosters work nah with loans and stuff it's the same FC Barcelona just means Foot Club Barcelona it's their "full name" I mean at least i think it is I don't get how loaning players and stuff works oh in general? yeah american sports is lame like dat :disappointed: lol i was looking on ESPN for standings for these teams and every league is just a bunch of teams from like 1 to 16 or something and then for MLS you got this West vs East bs lel yea it's dumb us 2 big scheduling OP yea, last year when barca and real came to play at memorial stadium they didn't have any stars can't have west teams going east all the time and playing at their equivalent of like 7 AM lel and dang, that kinda sucks hopefully these games will actually have the star players around PSG needs to have Zlatan :^)))))))))))) why don't US sports have relegation? :disappointed: it would be funny if the lakers got bumped into the d-league and then the SC warriors took their spot lel lel idk mang NBA owners 2 stronk and the D-League isn't really a seperate league it's to farm players, so I'd imagine the turnover is higher yeah i know lel it would be interesting if there were relegation idk how the scheduling works in the other leagues like does ManU have a "home" stadium? because potentially relegation might not be able to work if the SC Warriors have to host home games in their rinky dink gym or something like that yea looks like it I guess the richer teams just have larger stadiums it looks like from this brief look i had at something explaining loaning players it sounds like it's almost like playing for the d-league some other team pays your contract but if you're too scrub to get playtime they'll loan you out to another team and you play for them and get your minutes to get better kinda similar to getting dropped into the d-league and while you're on loan, the other club you play for will pay at least part of your contract oh okay so liek okay i wish US sports could be cool like europoor sports :^) :^) what the fuck is this game it's just unwatchable that's what happens when it's a memphis vs anyone game lel doesn't help that the warriors are also playing like crap wtf has gotten into klay tonight KLAY KLAY FUCKING KLAY PLS i mean tony allen is a good defender but this is 2real klay is 2-9 with 5 TOs okay 2-10 yea unwatchable like we're playing like shit the combak doe rite ugh we missed so many ez threes fucking Z-bo is a monster rite YO WHAT THE FUCK ARE THESE WARRIORS PASSES WHAT THE FUCK RIGHT EVERY TIME THEY PASS I HAVE A HEART ATTACK SERIOUSLY WTF I MEAN YEAH MEMPHIS IS A GOOD DEFENSIVE TEAM BUT THIS IS STILL RETARDED we can't buy a bucket not just that no one can fucking hold on to the fucking ball without almost losing it yea i think the only good thing we've had so far is Bogut Dray HB guarding their bigz curry's play has been really mixed even that is hard since ZBo is just 2gud fak where be and ]': fucking barnes really needed to hit that shot sigh i'm pretty sure this game is over fucking warriors yea :confused: fuck i really hope they learn from this shit lmao gasol being the PG clearly didn't work xDDDD lol fucking marccccc WHAT THE FUCK WHY AREN'T THESE GOING IN?

what does that mean those seats on the roof of the apartments are those less expensive? they seem to be so far i'm not sure but i think companies tend to have outings on the rooftops because it's not technically part of the park i don't think so you can just kinda have a party on the rooftop and also watch the game if you want ohhh wow so cool man oh wait yeah i mean it is pretty cool, imo those apartments ARENT a part of the stadium no yeah they're just close yeah and they have bleachers on top real close lol okay that makes a lot more sense i was confused since it blended in yeah otherwise they're just shitty seats lel is this wrigley field? yeah why is wrigley so ghetto it's not? like why is it so small iono why the park is small but the area is pretty nice ahh i see comiskey / US Cellular field where the white sox play is probably a bigger stadium it's right next to the highway yeah im just remembering when i see baseball stadiums like it rises super high but i guess at the ends of the field not really haha, you're probably thinking about fenway specifically, too i think they call that wall the green monster or something? mmm maybe then ye lol fucking huge wall lol yeah wtf and then AT&amp;T park just goes into the bay lol yeah i forgot about that thats why people are in the water waiting to catch baseballs lol i wonder how often that happens now i actually think at&amp;t park looks pretty nice it was pretty frequent when barry bonds would just hit them into the ocean every few days lol yeah this is a pretty nice picture okay you're right. i was wrong nvm who cares about baseball? wrigley lame :disappointed: no ocean :^( why is the right field ocean?? always so fucked up im guessing every baseball stadium is like that do you just mean why is right field like smaller or the walls are a bit janker? walls jankier like it juts in and out yeah iono like fenway doesn't have the monster wall in right field either ohhh I guess its because people were right handed so its less likely to go to right field hmm maybe so they made it slightly easier? i wouldn't be surprised maybe they just put the bullpen there and everyone just decided to put the bullpen there okay im dumb iono, i actually don't know where the bullpens are lol im so confused wait nvm seems really fucked up yeah more like boring ball XD it's kinda interesting how baseball fields aren't really regulated like other sports hey jason stop hating you're TW you're supposed to love the Yanks :^) :^) it's the nats now boiii jk braves lol almost all pitchers cause TW people are leaders :^) lol we love little league uploaded a file: Shot 2015-05-06 at 2.02.23 PM.png> :^) its pretty fucking unfair how the US always gets to the finals :simple_smile: because US is best country if TW wants to fuck with the rules they can go host their own LLWS :^) so the way it works is that one half of the bracket is JUST us, right? and then various teams from various states? and then the entire other half is international? yeah and lel 2014, Chicago defeated Las Vegas in the US Championship game 7-5 and played Seoul, South Korea for the Little League Championship as US champion - Seoul won the game 8-4. On February 11, 2015, Chicago was stripped of its US Little League Championship for fielding ineligible players; the US title was retroactively awarded to Las Vegas. chicago tried to cheat. and still fuckin lost to korea x) chicago is corrupt what can i say??? uploaded a file: Shot 2015-05-06 at 2.05.32 PM.png> LOL GARY LOLOLOL wait if the US competed as a country would they rek everyone? jesus is there no mercy rule well they're all kids so probably not hardcore rek uploaded a file: Shot 2015-05-06 at 2.06.11 PM.png> but i'm sure pooling all the talent together would make shit like that what if tw competed as a country less common lol they're all cities too its not like its ALL of tw yeah maybe TW is OP pretty sure each city can field one team? probably yeah but damn, these TW cities have a bigger talent pool to draw from mang like what the fuck can you expect from kids from Gary, Indiana except for having meth addicted parents and no savings and developmental problems :confused: wut. although if the game happened in '71 even in 1970? it was probably okayish back then thats before the flight yeah lol Gary, IN peaked in population in like '69-70 oh so it's like actual little league teams '70 is when the decline started happening like fucking the As from the fremont league yeah lol goes all the way up lol yeah pretty much something like that maybe they might consolidate a city team idk oh okay makes sense what did you think it was? I thought it was just like worldcup for baseball for 11-13 year olds lel getting callups to the state/national team oh lol read the redirect message wut uploaded a file: dank maymays i saw that whats a maymay a mispronunciation of meme which in turn has become a dank maemae of its own mehmehz? sallie maemaes? xD why is `For Free?` such a good song JSON? shet kevin you should work for toyota you'd fit right in! :^) x) u 2 beb let's just all go write spaghetti code everywhere we go xD at least we don't write code that determine if people live or die. idkkk lets dj again :simple_smile: ok how do i join ok nvm fuck it the waitlist again lol lol wut it won't let me add shit from youtube right now i guess their shit is broken gg fuckin don't have staging someone `git push -f origin master` a broken branch i always wonder why people don't have safeguards because startup mode = push code :disappointed: damn I'm DJing ]': always push to master duh i would join you baby, but i can't add music to my playlist right now :disappointed: ]': are you just do you make a new playlist everytime adding a few songs to playlist and removing? i dont get how it works no, you don't why can't you just only add it for that session but i wanna listen to diff stuff than what's on my playlist and iono plugdj OP fuckin real let's write our own competitor :simple_smile: shouldn't be so hard :simple_smile: let's use rails!!! :^) to just have a queue :^) for a person in a room im too lazy to pick music ima listen to top 50 on spotify XD I don't get why it has to come from a playlist as opposed to what, though? can't you just queue another song? like pick one off youtube i mean i guess the idea is that and not have to go through playlists you don't have to be around and actively picking songs so you just put it into a playlist queue iono, unless you're saying why have a saved playlist at all and why not just queue music each time? yeah thats what i think too should just be like karaoke clearly we need to write our own I mean porque no los dos X) aight let's make some boilerplate code :simple_smile: :simple_smile: is it time to short AMD? :^) why in case the 3XX series launch doesn't go well but if it goes well gg shorting is a very dangerous position if you're doing that just by itself yah short both AMD and NVDA !! damn such a baller why don't you all just short ENVA because I'm working here? :^) :^) thats insider trading though we know some shitter got through the doors it's okay can't be good for the company shieeet well SEC won't have access to our slack history :^) because we don't pay for slack :^) XDDD we don't know that kevin is a shitter because of insider information because it'll be past the 10k lolol :^( we just know kevin is a shitter from our personal experiences :^) YAML Wang is rekking me so hard ]': fak should Iget a 970 now or wait for 3XXX !!

While industry observers initially believed that the issues[7] impacting Broadwell would also affect Skylake, newer information suggests that Intel will be seeking to recover by maintaining the traditional "tick-tock" cadence for Skylake and shortening Broadwell's release cycle instead. oh wait so who's teaching the event? other RAs? theres a bunch and yeah the one i was sitting in was by a professor that we work with but idk joblife too hard i don't have the education just be a tutor in la with all the rich people you'll make more bank than we do wait did you go today? go where? and yeah maybe if i don't fail this next report its due tomorrow at 6 and no one has sent me any completed sections when'd you go to disneyland? can't they just assign a random 100 word essay about why they like disneyland that's educational gotta research oh they are going saturday i'm not going because i didn't like the ppl who are going why its a free trip isn't it it isn't you just pay less and its super long like you show up when it opens and leaves when the park closes i went before but its just too tiring oh fuck dat if no one is chill yeah idk disneyland imo isn't all that fun the rides are all pretty boring and too many strollers No CA adventure?

What a fucking analogy only novi I'm developing on my laptop which has windows installed but I need to be developing in a unix env wish I had more than 8gb ram right now I feel like a poor soviet college student developing on a potato and that's only because papa works for politburo otherwise I'd be doing it on a beet why don't you have a linux partition?? i never used windows for dev only time i have was when I was developing in Java for `Molecule.java` I use windows for my day to day shit was too lazy to make a linux partition in the past so I said fuck it might as well use a vm whats your day to day for like one year in college. i almost never logged onto my windows partition only time i would would be to play league with these gais I use my windows partition I have all my shit configured on there and switching between partitions to game is annoying I used to use linux up until like sophomore year ah i only gamed like once or twice a week for a while or if i really wanted to play. i would go to my club's office and play shit on that computer club? hkn hkn? hong kong network? eta kappa nu ooooh its a club its an "honor society" honor society right? ah im a bad influence for like 2-3 years our office was nice and tidy the fridge was always normal after I turned 21 and before then too i had it stocked with alcohol I'm proud of you and its always awk when someone stores food in there and during our office hours people open it and see a shit ton of liquor in there i should go back sometime and see if its still full of liquor just gotta bamlmer peak it balmer peak fuck are you already on the balmer's peak? i went to the upe office to get my stole and cords All about that molecule class Kelvin nobody there fuck it You know it was the pinnacle of your programming there was like almost always someone in the hkn office THE EMAIL SAID HE'D BE THERE 2-5 I WAS THERE AT 4 fuck upe HKN UPE EECS LSCS they're posers /giphy kilowog can't even hold OH correctly i wonder what the percentage split is for CS tutoring with HKN and UPE upe had tutoring? yea kek wut oh wait i remember sometimes there would be people in the office but it always felt like they were just chillin and talking with other upe people that's probably the case we legit had tutoring from like 10-5? we also had two offices. i think the UPE OH are much shorter 2-5? there's an 11-5 thing not sure what that was about ah hmm we needed to share the money we were raking it in from doing all the infosessions and the eecs department was like we'll be the ones who will distribute it unless someone specifically asks for you so then we went and emailed all our contacts and said please choose us we've worked with you before, would like to work with you again blahblha stuff like that i was surprised that a club could have like ~$100k in their war chest lel so the EECS department was going to give infosession holding to other groups? well they do they just wanted to mediate it so it'll be more even but we were like sure that sounds fine and i think we still ended with over even though there are 4 or 5 groups lol A H Q A H Q A H Q A H Q
H Q A
Q A H they're from tw :simple_smile: UPHORICE /giphy euphoric is MSI single elim? /giphy kappa best of 3? nah it's not this is group and then prob double elim yeah that'd be my guess double elim best format imo NO ONLY LOSERS NEED LOSER BRACKET did you all get your 1 IP MSI summoner icons? :^) but shouldn't they be given the chance to come back? i mean they have the chance oh after 1-0 right? it's one round robin group top 4 advance then best of 5 single elim you can say the same thing for smash tournaments most of those are double elim i'm not saying i don't like double elim i'm just saying i don't think it's the BEST format or anything it's just different no more xpeke doe )': its different but i feel like for most esports tournaments double elimination works well i think like 3 games that is true since you play a lot more games for double elim yeah, if the point of having double elim is to hand out more opportunities for people to come back i think it would be overkill for like Bo5s lol i still don't get yeah thats reasonable why rito didn't get MSI to sponsor the MSI but smash is best of 5 sometimes and they still do double elim if anything MSI should sue rito for trademark infringement smash just has double elim but smash is also like 20 mins because people want to watch more games :^) per best of five and implying that MSI is sponsoring it h4h4h4 which i'm sure is part of the reason you're implying that people don't want to watch lol nah but with short matches and high paced matches although i personally think its more exciting to watch smash than lol it's more fun to watch yeah i don't even know half of the techstuff they're doing but it's still fun lol can sometimes feel like watching basketball or football or more recently boxing lol after you get a lead lel you do what you can to keep it i would say basketball doesn't fall under that as much as other sports though but yeah to an extent it sometimes happens tho depends on the matchup i guess like the bulls vs the bucks :^) jk :^) last game i think it would be like clips vs spurs and when the spurs get a small lead, pop starts hacking someone hacking? hack-a-shaq hack-a-deandre-jordan intentionally fouling lol to send a low % FT shooter to the line defend your lead, prevent the other team from establishing a rhythm oh yeah didn't the rockets do that in game 2? in the playoffs everyone does it if there's a player who can be hacked mmm makes sense cause you force the other team to decide if they want to have their best defender usually whether or not to keep them in be in the game and defend but miss FTs yeah its a trade off but it is a sport and its within the rules you do what you can to win it sorta sucks for the viewers. but its within the rules yeah, which is why i think they shouldn't change the rule the league is currently trying to decide whether they should somehow change the rule so as to eliminate hacking ahh i see lol unlike boxing all the diehard boxing fans are defending mayweather for his fighting style i understand it. but i don't think its fun to watch i think "real" basketball fans would not want the rule changed either because hitting FTs is important but in the end and if you can't hit FTs why should everyone else be punished the NBA is an organization to make money to bring the viewers in you want to make it more exciting that's true, but it would also be that if you change the rule you'd really just be changing it because of a handful of players mmm so you're saying there aren't many people that get hacked those players should get better at the FTs? yeah there are like maybe 10-15 people who would regularly get hacked maybe less tbh i see its pretty much just calculating EV like obviously that doesn't mean that there are only 10-15 people who are that bad at FT shooting like if they have normal posession yeah p much they have a 70% chance of making 2 points and like 20% chance of getting 3 or something and if that combined is than that person's FT % then you should just hack them yeah pretty much because of the teams that are left in the playoffs you could maybe hack Bogut, Iguodala, Deandre, Dwight............... Perkins, Noah and that's like it lol would probably even take Kendrick Perkins off the list because he doesn't play meaningful minutes typically oh and Josh Smith so like 7-8 players maybe lol westdoor kinda looks like kevin wtf wut nothing about this guy looks like me what the fuck i agree with kevin here idk i think they can change it to jason is just racist kevin if you hack someone off ball team chooses whoever on the floor at that time to take 2 FTs no that's awful imo wait jk i was talking about the interpreter ? It would discourage hacking people without the ball just to get FTs i think at most you should let the other team in bound mm they decide between inbound and FTs? yeah maybe but even then, it's just such a cop out it's stupid but then yeah its stupid might as well somehow get rid of it or keep it in like why have these bad FT shooters just get away with being bad at shooting FTs? it would be like if in the LCS there was some ADC who sucked at CSing for w/e reason and instead of forcing that person to get better at CSing you change the game mechanics so that everyone passively gets gold from units that die around them idk hacking someone who doesn't have the ball just seems stupid so like HotS i mean you can also argue that point like if they did have the ball or were shooting they'd have to take their own FTs for getting rid of denying i mean i wish i could deny in league playing GP was fun when he still could LOL i like it so much better because it gives you a much better way of controlling your lane pushes and with the added aspect of denying a bit of exp for them it also adds another dimension of whether you want to allow both of you to get stronger or both of you to be weaker under the assumption that you'd be sacrificing CS for denies or vice versa which would be interesting or you could just be OP and get all the CS and denies :simple_smile: in dota people try to do the latter you obviously prioritize CS but its difficult because theres someone the opposite side trying to do the exact same thing to you damn why is MSI in Tallahassee? i know why prithvi is always mia now he was scrimming with SKT because he's now at MSI :^) dank is 2cool4us mid vlad da bess he doesn't have ignite doe clearly is the best @numb1a nah ghost flash old skool damn just biggest meta setter lol flash pool RIGHT I was like that's some level shit dude obv never seen numba1 demos wtf is this like why wouldn't you just walk into the bush? that's some level awareness :^) deft is a retard dude vlad is op man he draws hella bans now ur OP :simple_smile: and i think hes best mid hes a shit top laner maybe you're the shit top laner :^) i dont think soooo m8 UHHH WELL I THINK SO M8 are you going to league tonight you buttbanger ya well i said id play yesterday but it was down WELL IT WAS UR FAULT (hey, get into NU) dam dude i shut down riots servers get into NU pls hopeee so shieeet y not UIC med skoo yeah why not :disappointed: or be a sanitation engineer at jardine water filtration plant ye :simple_smile: deft best tristana tsm throwing so hard that was pretty funny lol they getting rekt /giphy korean clapping hail the korean overlords /giphy digimon world /giphy digimon world ... are you fucking serious? what a fucking nerd kelvin is just mad jelly he don't have ballstreams at all let alone better-ballstreams :simple_smile: give me your snapchat Kelvin and I'll subscribe you to my ballstream fuck off novi no one wants to see your shriveled raisins it's more wrinkled than shriveled also they're a lot saltier than raisins gotta get dat NaCl brah fuck dude i drank too much yesterday i ended up sleeping at 4 am tsk tsk and woke up at 9:30 to get to work i ended up playing games because i was like. im too drunk to go to sleep and i just ate a huge burrito for lunch and it was so good but now my stomach is too full and i feel sleepy #kelvinchouproblems what do you do in chicago nothing i don't have a life GG ??? what about friends/coworkers in chicago i don't have friends GG nah, i mean the weather is OP now so i'm sure everyone will start going out much more frequently and summer hours is coming up soon so people will be out of the office around 2 or so on fridays to go do w/e the fuck they wanna do oh damn wtf summer hours? thats pretty ridiculous Dude you always gotta get a salad for lunch Otherwise you suffer the itis what itis doin an arena run right now 7-2 with a janky ass shaman deck u think ur fucking speshul yes yes I do /giphy super special theres a 20 year old voted into parliament yesterday they're making laws and we're just here with our dank memes what are we doing with our lives kelvin would you really rather be making laws? or would you rather be making dank memes? think about it man this priest got 2 loot hoarders from his piloted shreddeers :confused: he just did velens chosen divine spirit inner fire to a mogushan warden wtf Welcome to the terror dome eh still got 7 wins got my 2 quests out of the way with that get rekt by healthcheesebestcheese its exactly like kevin's stupid priest deck except in arena lol I'd actually rather be making laws though dank memes come and go but laws last forever (until they get struck down by another law) but what about such classics as I have over 300 confirmed kills something gorilla warfare?

$.post('/kelvin', {novdip: 'coolio'}) ``` ??? oh thats how you make ajax requests right? yeah it made a post request of JSON to the localhost page with the link /kelvin and a json object well, technically it's a plaintext post but the context of the plaintext is json of novdip: coolio wow i have no idea what is happening well, unless it auto adds the request type of JSON to it when passed a JS object which yeah, it probably does i usually just use the `$.ajax` long form i don't really like the shorthand `$.post` and `$.get` y? do you like being more explicit with your function parameters? also sometimes $.post and $.get don't quite work well, idk why I sometimes have small issues with those functions we write wrappers around the $.ajax so I never actually use that we just have something called like doJSONRequest or doRequest yeah, that works, too and then you pass in what you care about because its annoying spying on $.ajax so we just spy on the doRequest for testing fuck this page has so many width-breakpoints you trawling through their css? yeah :disappointed: lol how many do you have?

Jorah isn't supposed to have greyscale But people are speculating that connington got rolled into Jorah seems like it but what about aegob? *aegon? I'm not even sure how the fuck he's gonna come in Unsure at this point Idk grrm finds a way I suppose so are you still watching it? you mean (f)aegon they also got rid of quentyn wtf novi i didn't know you read the books I've read all of them and I had forgotten about Quentyn yeah when i was watching the episode last night i was just like good call what the fuck is happening jorah is now joncon quentynn victarion and barry the victarion bit might still come in idk man but the timing would be fucked its so fucked up they're making the story completely diff imo yeah also, they're basically cutting out all of the iron islands shit and that was a big part of the books yeah and wtf jon snow is going to hard home? THEY GOT RID OF EDD FETCH ME A BLOCK LOL I wonder if they're gonna run into pirates around hardhome sigh because that did happen and then some wildlings ended up in Braavos man i don't know if sam is ever gonna go to oldtown either or the baby shit im so god damn confused whats happening in the show it's basically a different series now with similarly named characters hahaha well adaptations typically do i feel like they're fucking up some of the arya bits too arya's arc is prolly one of my favorites the kindly old man is pretty different did you read the mercy chapter yeah I read that the one that was released yeah I can't believe i thought it was great so gud they just made him Jaqen dude im okay with that actually they didn't want to find another actor I would read a book just about like Arya LOL and the kindly old man COULD be jaqen you dont know he isn't but pate whars pate wheres stoneheart fuck if stoneheart doesn't get shown this season what the fuck pate has been cut out he'd make no sense given the current plot oh. and stoneheart might come in next season sounds like or at the end of this season sam isn't going to oldtown at all then fucking Brienne isn't even supposed to be near winterfell no reason to go to oldtown oh yeah that confused the fuck out of me too theres no jeyne what is happening the entire north is fucked up smh i don't agree with this sansa step at all why did she just give up and go to winterfell why she didn't know petyr didn't tell her she did in the show you're all fucking nerds petyr told her she was marrying ramsay fuck you kevin just because you dont like to read books :^( i can't read how are you on slack i have an interpreter damn nah man petyr took her north and then told her she didn't know from the get go okay true but he did technically give her a choice if she wanted to go back he wouldn't stop her he was spouting on and on about vengeance and shes like fuck it, lets do it live basic you know what's gonna happen Sansa + Theon are gonna kill Ramsay at some point when Stannis comes you're assuming Stannis is going to win the battle I'm thinking hes going to lose but the...wtf happens also i don't get the show *but then the show said that stannis has a larger army in the books stannis has a much smaller army than bolton and he's getting snowed in yeah the books. it looks like stannis is so fucked but then they capture Theon and his sis do you read the mereneese blot? which might lead to more info? mereneese blot? just tons of analysis on what could happen i love soaking up this shit the world is so intricate I love it grrm isn't illogical so i'm thinking a lot of these at least seem very reasoanble you know R + L = J right everyone should know that yeah it was kinda assumed from the books too given the description of how Ned found Lyanna in the tower of joy? yeah she was covered in blood mmm but had been pregnant or some shit? I'm not sure yeah maybe but the show is hinting at it so hard like the scene where stannis was talking about ned was honorable blahblah too honorable to have a bastard yeah he seemed confused by his existence there was also but idk it might just be there to get fans a theorizing "A targayren alone in the world. What a terrible thing" cut to jon nah that's reading too deep into it idk man Aemon expressed similar sentiments in the books i don't think the producers of the show are dumb im sure they thought about this stuff too or maybe they're just fucking with the book readers but i fucking HATE grey worm in this storyline its so stupid why did he have to live while barry died i felt like it was a waste of screentime him and missandei they're making him into a little bitch useless goddamn scene I guess they're trying to humanize him or something to pull tears from the audience .... he gets no tears from me because idk if he'll be able to play any kind of political roll at all yeah me neither he can't procreate anyway useless also Xaro the whole Mereen political scenario is different oh my god the hizdaar zo loraq the power between the two is completely flipped which I think they changed to make Daeranys more of a you go girl from the story and the book oops I meant Hizdar not Xaro i even predicted that daenarys was going to propose when she walked into that cell man they definitely changed her characterization i bet the show watchers were like wtf yeah shes a lot more fucked up just pushing someone into her dragons and eating him just earlier she was all about this compassion BS barry died she is pissed barry was her secret lover LOL wut i was kidding thought so man I wonder but yeah. i think they got rid of faegon and joncon completely is there going to be a scene where Dany flies off on Drogon? like when Jorah gets there? there has to be but then like hm I wonder if Tyrion is gonna get enslaved mmmm theres no battle or are they gonna make it there np? outside of the walls of mereen so i have no idea this is so weird the battle might still happen but without the ironborn arc.... yeah thats what i was thinking it doesn't make sense i think jorah is gonna come back and tyrion will take the place of barry actually maybe when dany leaves that's prolly the plan on drogon Tyrion is basically a King's hand and now she needs a new Queen's hand yeah, they haven't met yet in the books right? from what i remember nope they were on opposite sides of the walls of Mereen at the end yeah thats what i thought so im thinking the battle wont happen most likely not but then like all of the political strife in Essos is basically eliminated OH maybe they'll do the battle after Tyrion comes and introduce the ironborn arc after Tyrion comes ooo then after the battle they head west maybe the timing is so messed up though since they haven't shown the election or anything they can't do that in only one episode right? it takes months to sail to essos from the iron islands they could swing it maybe dude the months thing idk if that applies like Stannis was in Braavos but then back in dragonstone in like a week I think they could say iron islands -&gt; mereen would take like a month nerds oh shit the preview of the next episode says that Jorah and Tyrion run into slavers hmm oh shit no why'd you spoil i stopped watching the previews so i can speculate hard oh it's not the video preview it's the text description for the episode oh goddammit and fuck you kevin sorry :disappointed: Kevin, GoT is pretty mainstream you're the nerd for not watching it fucking get with the program LotR is pretty mainstream too but if you were talking about that like you are talking about GoT now you'd still be nerds :^) it's because book reading is nerdy :disappointed: also I'm gonna nap now nerds fk u wow kevin did you actually read LotR? no i'm not a NERD :^) honestly, i try reading some books every now and then but i just can't get through them i get super bored after maybe 1/3 of whatever book i'm reading less usually then you're not reading what you enjoy yeah and i just haven't found anything that i enjoy a lot of authors, i just don't like how they write but you shouldn't have to get 1/2 way through the book before finding that out no what i meant is like ive been reading one book for the past 2 weeks lol i'll just power through even if i didn't like it its 1100 pages long and then eventually i just can't take it anymore and put it down and never look at it again what kinds of book do you read? it's been awhile since i've actually bothered since i've kind of just given up on finding stuff to read oh. i just listen to rap now i find that i really enjoy :simple_smile: large connected storylines like game of thrones like GoT? dank so ive been reading space operas since i also enjoy a lot of scifi im currently reading the night's dawn trilogy specifically _The Neutronium Alchemist_ this is pretty solid review Read literature and become cultured sounds like civ i love this gif what is it from dunk contest some crazy dunk and kobe pulls out the 10 but then people edit it for different numbers and just anything that's not a 10 is hilarious lol LOL yeah thats pretty good thats a good edit it even has the light refelctions i couldn't tell it was shopped yeah it's pretty OP watdo gaiz im at work i'm still @ wrk :disappointed: but kevin is already going home oh wut arent your normally home at this time well right now i'm just waiting on something to finish being QA'd and then if everything is good i'm gonna bounce dammm why not just bounce and follow up at home! i don't feel like bringing my laptop back home today :disappointed: but maybe i will oh right you're too cool to ever bring laptop home :disappointed: i wish i could be as good as you with your work life balance #siliconevalley uh isn't that in LA?

UIC? fuck :^) answer these nogs' questions i'm not ur pr rep bby you're doing a pretty good job at it maybe you should appeal to the school Kevin you like being a buttfag so why not become a PR guy and brown nose all day? the pay is good and you'll get to work with some of the finest rectums the city of Chicago has to offer idk i'm trying to think about what kind of jobs i'd be interested in that aren't development i feel like i might enjoy doing something like recruiting but recruiting doesn't pay well at laest i don't think so recruiting at the highest level for executives does but to start with, nah on the plus side you'd work with tons of girls which is a good and bad thing and most of the time they're pretty attractive thats how they get people to join oh man you should hear about sports recruiting prob only college sports recruiting mmm not sure but yeah for sure well i know what you're talking about and yeah college sports recruiting is super sleazy like that sometimes i'm sure to some extent professional recruiting is similar but i'm sure it's just more prevalent in college recruiting situations because they're just recruiting fucking teenage boys lol i don't know about professional recruiting hmmm i thought like professional recruiting is more like if they want you and you don't have a job you'll take it most likely no, i meant professional sports since novi was talking about college sports i was just talking about only sports wish they recruited like that for CS departments no i know im talking about professional sports as well hm, i guess i just ignored the whole aspect of recruiting people who are unproven like do you really think that professional athletes would choose to go to a team just because the women are hot? not because of what they think they'll be able to prove on the team no ofc not and the money they get? but it still helps because it's unlikely that the offers would differ that much from various orgs idk man showing a guy a good time is part of what defines whether or not he thinks he's a good cultural fit for a team yeah what novi said lol man that just sounds so sketch that sounds like prostitution a little bit but that's how high roller business works don *don't worry one day you'll be sending hot escorts to reel in members for your company hahahaha we think escort services use square and everytime we find them we have to shut them down oh it's true because its against our TOS they definitely do how can you guys tell? large charges? if they move around and like the large charges and we call and if they tell us what kinda business or documentation we can prolly guess i don't do our risk stuff :disappointed: but this is what ive heard should i get an iphone 6+ or a samsung gs6 edge? android is best don't you remember bendgate??????????????????????? xDDDDDDD don't get a 6+ i think its way too large i'm good with the size but didn't you try the 6 already? my 1+ is already similarly sized and you don't like ios? yeah iono :anguished: have you considered these? fuck off :simple_smile: the galaxy s6 is gonna be better i'm mostly just thinking about battery life how's the s6 battery life? iphone life is kinda meh right? nah iphone is p gud the standby drain is like 0 just plug your phone in while you're at work problem solved carry around a spare battery in your wallet? xddddddddddd fine, S6 or S6 edge? iphone is so good for battery life i can easily do 2 maybe 3 days without charging yeah it's op, navdoop don't listen to him dude when I used the iphone I was like why is everything so dumbed down like it was frustrating for me to use the UI Wow Stanford has special career fairs just for freshmen and sophomores ): wait why granted I'm prolly just bitching here I remember wanting to copy paste shit and then share some stuff and with android a long press gets you a ton of options but with the iphone it didn't wait it should do the same thing... I just remember it not doing the same thing hmmm well it doesnt give you a ton it gives you copy and select but thats all i needed but wait kevin didn't you use an iphone and not like it earlier? why are you giving it another chance because i wanna be part of the kool kids klub :confused: hasa diga iphone6 sgs6e all the way :disappointed: that was quick. damn my current phone on GSMarena has a 66hour rating for battery life iphone 6+ has 79h and sgs6e has 73 so not bad maybe whats the iphone 6 battery life 61 oh damn not bad the 6's battery life was OP from what i remember the size of the 6+ gives it a huge battery idk i guess i agree that the battery life if you use it a lot during the day it drops to like 50% yah, not so great but the standby is always OP as fuck but ive had tons of friends whenever i see them with an android they tend to charge it whenever they can really? depends on the phone i'd say i can easily get buy with one charge a night by like at school same when we're studying they're always charging their phone you remember what phones they had? maybe they had the older phones i feel like android phones in general have made a lot of strides towards closing the gap in terms of quality with iphones dude wtf season 3 of vghs is getting so real wtf did I just watch oh they had like galaxy s4s htc one idk it was a year ago maybe its improved a ton since last year in general android phones are closing the gap, but i think the consensus opinion is that this time around the sgs6 really took a leap forward ahh i see to be of the same caliber at least in terms of hardware most of the time i question the build quality of android phones people really like the build and camera and stuff but prob cause they just copied apple lmao like they look pretty meh and it feels cheap (just my opinion) yeah no, i agree i know its pretty stupid but i feel like the weight of the phone matters a lot yeah it def does at least it does to me when i hold it actually that's kinda why i didn't like the iphone 6 i thought it was too light lol too light for you? yeah ah you're used to huge screens though now so a 6+ might be up your alley i had a nexus 5 not just that though, my moto x is similar sized and it felt lighter than my iphone 5 and felt heavier than the iphone 6 nexus 5 is pretty light yeah and it was plastic actually idk, maybe my whole perception of all this weight stuff is fucked or it felt plasticy because of my huge phone lol mmm yeah anyways gonna go home now ttyl WOAH KEVIN IS STILL AT WORK AT EIGHT PM??? such a hard worker!!!!!!! did you get your free dinner ye :simple_smile: naisu "ekko is so black he can steal time" -rito mfw /giphy nigga please But but but what happened to iPhone 6 Da Bess?? jcole best gif :3 Kevin tell me a bedtime story I think I'll sleep soon and it would be just super duper if you could send me to into dreamland Nigga please. The End. why can't this be greentext by J. Cole]

[Intro]
Cole
Cole, world
Yeah
Let me take y'all back man
As I do so well

[Verse 1]
Wasn't nothin' like that
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first, time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin' straight crushin' tryna play this shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreaming, man what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions getting deep and
Wet dreaming thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said "You ever had sex before?"
Damn

[Hook]
And I ain't never did this before, no (x8)

[Verse 2]
I wrote back and said: "of course I had sex before" knowing I was frontin'
I said, "I'm like a pro, baby," knowing I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But, she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
"Oh you a pro homie? Well I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'"
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinking how that body look naked when you laying on the bed
Teacher, please don't make me stand up
I wrote back like "Yeah, baby, sound like a plan"
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death my nigga, my stomach turned
Talking shit knowing damn well I was a virgin
Fuck

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You know that feeling when you know you finna bone for the first time
I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm praying, "God don't let me bust quick"
I'm watching pornos trying to see just how to stroke right
Practice putting condoms on, how it go right
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touching and her face start blushing
And a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing
On me, ooh girl don't stop
It's time for action: pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
"I wanna get something off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby be gentle, cause..."

In my undies playing hearthstone shit livin the life I'm making a sandwich And masturbating :) so I just finished watching the latest episode of GoT the Sansa scene was more tame than what Ramsay did to fake-Sansa-aka-Jeyne-Poole no lickaroo from Theon thoughts? uploaded a file: for Android Upload> and commented: :) i know but it was still pretty bad imo alfie allen did some very good acting on that portion but yeah i think it also creates a hugely different dynamic when its happening to sansa versus when it happens to jeyne like from how the show was portraying sansa learning from littlefinger i thought that she would at least be able to put up a little bit of resistance or thought of something when she was like fuck you to myranda but nope I figured she would when she was talking with Myranda yeah she just took it so im a bit disappointed I think she'll screw over Ramsay later with the help of the winterfell peeps while Ramsay is distracted by Stannis i think and then Theon smuggles her out or something she'll escape with theon yeah like what happens in the books i thought also we're gonna get Cat of the Canals soon OMG the hype is real i love those scenes in the books those chapters* and yeah those along with the Tyrion chapters are my fave i basically thought only the first half of the episode was good arya was great, jbear and tyrion was great lady olenna and cersei was pretty decent then it just went downhill Jaime and Bronn was like meh imo fuck that was the stupidest scene they just walk in they literally just walk in??!?!?! brb taking a shit like wtf do they think would happen? huh what do you mean it's just hard to believe two men would think they could sneak in, steal a princess, and then make it back to another country I just thought that idea was dumb oh yeah but just them sneaking in and the fight with the sand snakes made me want to gag it was so stupid lololol it seemed so fake yeah do you think obara poisoned bronn they made a specific scene to show him getting cut it's possible she keeps saying shes oberyns daughter and oberyn is like but somehow I doubt it always use poison in the books they knew about poisons dude you know that feel when you lose to a nub running a terrible deck but he gets insane draws that completely counter your hand? :simple_smile: who doesn't i also know the feel when i get that one out and win I'm playing some kind of dumbass token pally right now fuuu i have 2 quests for pally and priest lel hearthstoning at work??? i don't have the legendaries to play control of either them or midrange you can try running pally without tirion just replace it with something else big that gets silenced lel but tirion so stronk and i don't have any big legendaries :disappointed: :disappointed: im too poor well what good big stuff do you have? dr boom? yah thats it :disappointed: im pretty unlucky i have nozdormu!!! :^) nice best card right now I wish I had alexstrasza and jaraxxus shieeet gotta catch up on got and SV lol we all do i wish i had the moolah to spend bbl lunch wish we could trade cards in hearthstone :disappointed: LOL playing patron warrior is so fucking funny sometimes I just did 40 damage in one turn to the enemy with two frothings yeah i love patron warrior also i love playing against like a face hunter with patron warrior they don't kill your warsong commander they have tons of 1/1s easy board full of 3/2s yup man I hate combo druid whats combo druid 3/4 of the game is hoping he doesn't have combo force + savage oh yah 22 points of damage i like patron warrior cause its like my first time actually playing a more control type deck and its feels so gud stabilizing and the hunter has 2 cards in hand holy fuck this mech mage got so lucky topdecks alex to save herself followed by fireball to kill the 6 health dude I had that would have killed her omg qq kelvin im having so much caviar like actual caviar? or the company company oh nice :heart: how long do they take to deliver now? hopefully 1 hour should I start an arena run or should I just buy a pack?

oh wait no you beat EV already CONGRATULATIONS!!! one was golden too so hella good yeh exactly last pack baylieve and it's shit lolol you just paid $50 for a prophet velen and a legendary of your choice do you feel dirty? i would. nah it's about the dust of which I now have 3700 I'm thinking I'm gonna craft 2 ancients of lore alexstrasza maybe jaraxxus? hmm OH 2 ancients of lore 2 bane of dooms and an alex dont you need jaraxxus for demonlock? you already have malganis? don't have malganis he's a bit optional and currently demon zoo is best warlock followed by handlock if I had jaraxxus I'd have all handlock cards with the two ancients of lore I'd have a strong druid deck just craft whatever and spend another $50 to get more cards/dust:^) the two ancients of lore were necessary now I can legit play druid I have is it 40 packs for $50? yeah oh wait you didn't have ancient of lores tsktsk I never played druid... :disappointed: and I didn't get them in packs go figure so I'm thinking top contenders right now are ahh sounds reasonable archmage - jaraxxus - alex archmage and alex play some freeze mage :simple_smile: don't have doomsayers do you have mal no malganis but he's optional oh hm like pretty optional i feel like hes fairly integral hrmm doomsayers are only epics I also don't have thalnos plus idk if I'd like playing freeze mage seems slow and boring to me compared to other decks you don't have thalnos??? oh wait nvm i only have him cause he was the first legendary i cracked lol he's only played in a few decks hes played in so many of my decks and in the decks he's played in only freeze mage really requires him he was integral in my miracle rogue deck still great in oil rogue yeah he's the only card I'm missing from a perfect oil rogu you know what I think alex and archmage are best but I only have 2900 right now :((( just buy $20 worth of packs mmm i need to take a crap i think ima play hearthstone today. lol that game took so fuckin long lol I saw i didn't see what he did to the sludge belcher did he do kevin's deck ? i just saw that it turned into a 15/19 and i got rekt. nah nightmare from ysera ohhhh okay two of them? yeah i see makes sense sigh why didn't he get laughing sisters? i had a chance :disappointed: thankfully missing armor twice didn't make a diff in the game i like how it's "my" deck :^) the phone screen is a bit too cluttered the only person whos dumb enough to play a deck that relies on 4 cards in the deck HEY STFU :^( its true though i don't remember what was in it your entire deck revolves around 4 cards i thought it was a pretty standard deck that otherwise revolves around those 4 divine spirit and inner fire if you dont draw those cards you're sorta screwed :((( yeah i guess if i don't draw those then it's just a mediocre deck of monsters and nothing else interesting yah pretty much i mean its a legit win con just it isn't consistent. it's okay i don't play that deck anymore if i play i just play this random fucking warrior deck that prithvi can't beat :^) lel lel i just lost as a grim patron warrior im bad i was also sitting on the toilet its hard thinking on the toilet yup you down 2 gta kevin? man I hate losing to bs homebrew decks also I feel like having fiery war axe early vs not basically decides some games as control warrior lel i'm still at work brah i'll be back soon ish though? working on some CSS stuff :^( you're already going back home? i'm gonna be here for another 4 hours :disappointed: aightttt :disappointed: maybe I should just witcher yeah it seriously does you have witcher 3? jason is a dank pirator :^( kelvin let's not be pirators oh i haven't pirated in a long time kevin r u proud 4 me? i think the last time i pirated was playing splinter cell conviction with thomas i pirated Lightroom :disappointed: .... its $90 is it? wtf kevin buy the student edition thats what i did its worth oh man i also want a ne wdesktop is there a standalone? new desktop i couldn't find a standalone i don't want the CC subscription :confused: so i can do lightroom better yeah... gg kevin you just didn't care. i wanted to get it through adobe but adobe doesn't fucking have a standalone on their site anymore zzz or at least if they did it was hard to find i guess i didn't bother trying amazon or w/e cause amazon has it for 79 also but lightroom 6 is out !!! oh hm well im still okay with lightroom 5 im not a master photographer i just play around until i think it looks nice. you're basically a master photographer man all nat geo photographers do is take a picture on their DSLR in Auto and then import their JPG to Lightroom and then mess with some sliders and then they export it to the editors :^) jpg? wtf you always take in raw whats wrong with u i can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not because i was being sarcastic :^( i was not being sarcastic i do take in raw yeah obv you have much more control i shoot everything in RAW too i do compress though i do lossless compression in the raw no reason not to i just have 100% raw and then compress to JPG after processing oh yeah i export as jpg with the highets quality ya why don't you compress the raw? what camera do you have? and iono if it was a setting on my camera wow high roller $1600+ !!!! :^) its definitely a setting in the camera wha tdo you have this was my dad's old camera well, i bought a D3300 but otherwise i've been using an RX100 Mk2 what lens do you have the RX100 Mk2 is a point and shoot fuck cybershots lolol so no lens and it's not a cybershot is it??? thats what the first google thing said no im asking about the d3300 -_- no shit the point and shoots don't have a lense i sorta wanna buy a new lens i didn't think you would actually google what my camera was it's all about the SLR the fstop doesn't go low enough and hand developing BW film :^) and find that it was a point and shoot i googled it i know d3300 is a nikon dslr my d3300 is only going to come with the standard 18-55mm oh... :confused: should i play witcher with mouse and keyboard or find a usb cable if i get a new lens i might get a 35mm f/1.8 lens these are the lens i have its really nice for never switching lens yeah but sometimes i wish i could have more depth of field i was looking at an 18-200 but i bet if i switch to like an 18-55 sometimes i wish i could zoom more might as well just buy two cameras. why not just use an iphone 6 camera? get :)))) highest rated lens on amazon 135 mm is pretty close zoom it goes to f/2 doe!!! just get closer to whatever you're shooting i mean its only one f-number nono you need to get farther from whatever you're shooting oh that's what you meant yeah most of the time I agree that 18-55 is good enough it's still the highest rated lens on amazon!1!!!!11!11!! but its nice having the larger range occasionally fuck it let's just attach a telescope to our cameras jason what camera are you bringing ... kevin that makes no sense :^) wait so you're just using the kit lens? i mean only for the time being i'm sure i'll branch out later and get different lenses for different photos that i'd want to shoot this is a good upgrade for the kit lens i feel like i'd be fine with the one i'll have and if anything i would just get like an 18-200 or so lens or some other specialized lens just my phone #SCRUB being iOS master race is sad i don't have a micro usb cable to play witcher on QQ do you wanna borrow my point and shoot? :simple_smile: lel it's actually v good I'm not too big on taking the pictars best point and shoot you can get :simple_smile: within the price bracket i guess mmm i know a lot of people getting mirror less as their point and shoot and im like jesus point and shoot is as much as a normal dslr and they put a normal lens on it it looks so weird. but its light. yeah mirrorlesses are interesting it's the new hypeness i agree its pretty hipster so jason, why don't you have one jason hasn't reached that level yet :disappointed: btw jason, you'll be the only one on our trip without a camera 1 out of 3 tsktsk is this picture OK kelvin?

Kelvin finish your thought :smirk: k i dont know well, think about it and get back to me if you can it's an important thing to know about yourself well pretty much im typically interested in like one person and everyone else im just like normal friends with so its like a fairly heavy investment at a time sometimes it works out sometimes it doesnt and when it doesnt, it takes a while for me to get over it idk if that makes sense seems like it does the main difference between you and I is that you don't mind the repeated company of a girl who's not necessarily someone you'd pursue or find all that interesting I'd say in that regard you're the more genial one yeah sure well, and the other difference is I guess I get over girls rather quickly i mean they're just people women are objects to be objectified :dank: them being of the opposite sex doesn't make that much of a difference I agree which is why if they're worse than the alternative people I can hang out with and don't offer me much in terms of social connectivity I won't talk to them yeah, very reasonable their sex only really comes into play if I want something more than that although, i don't have too many friends im a loner perfectly natural dont know why these nigs put up with me habit I guess hue hue hue i guess for me I put up with you because I'm hoping you'll give me insider trading knowledge once :square: goes public i never make plans :^) and people just include me in plans and i go along otherwise im just here in my apartment jerking it and talking with you guys lel lel well it's only a problem if you think it is and want more meh otherwise you're just doing what you're personality finds best planning things is sometimes more trouble than its worth like for casual hangouts its not too important to me but i love planning trips like 2 week long vacations i was the one who planned my entire itinerary for my first europe trip all 5 weeks i planned out each city, and how we're going to get to each city rough time frame around that dang, nice so i guess planning large things is more important to me than casual hangouts although i feel like to be better friends you need the casual hangouts every so often and i just don't start it sounds like you know what you want and generally have it with only a minor digression from that in that you feel like you might want to start casual hangouts more congrats, you're a well adjusted adult an oddly rare thing :simple_smile: hahaha thanks. lol don't hear that too much living in fraternity I've come to realize just how deep some people's problems run compared to that you guys are the pinnacle of solidarity honestly, compared to the general populace sometimes when I say that it sounds like I'm trivializing your struggles and what not but you guys have generally done a good job of transitioning into adulthood and that should be recognized wow I'm getting so gushy i planned my roadtrip kelvin! unlike gary who's just gonna wing it!!! planning it was so fun :simple_smile: Gary is gonna breakdown in the desert and have to drink his own piss i don't know man i have no idea what im doing and fuck you kevin i want to go on a road trip fuck you im not cool enough to travel with the bros :disappointed: :disappointed: just fly out there and intercept Gary on the road perhaps on a bitchin' harley holy shit that would be so fun if we just knew where he was and pulled up along side on harleys one on each side no. :simple_smile: thats how you get killed. kevin plant a bug on him :^) :dank: dont be stupid. and then we shoot out his tires pls do it in gta dont do it in rl xDDDDD :dank: the guys I used to work with over at Merril Lynch were huge motorbike fanatics they would all go on riding trips through the mountains they left for a few days to go to Appalachians during my internship Micro SMG????? ???????? wait wasn't that in san andreas? iirc you could basically snipe people super easily with it Oh we were talking about shooting out tires I think there's no spread in gta v. Just damage falloff how to transition to postgrad life iono reyarch has a better idea :disappointed: ): I'll just save money and fly to Chicago every weekend yeah that's dece are we playing anything??? kevin pls do you know anything about fuck you kevin are you fucking with me? did you link this particular lens to me? i can't recall lolol i'm asking you if this is a good lens to buy and good price this is the lens i have, except a more recent version of it that also does macro shots oh ok my version doesn't have macro shots dank its really good if you dont like switching around lens yeah the auto focus is decent although its annoying sometimes when you're trying to switch around but fuck then the kit lens is just a waste, right? :confused: and purposefully get things out of focus for the shot to look nice and wtf no one should ever use the kit lens thats just blasphemy i know but i have one so who cares i wish i could have spent like throw it away $100 less you wont be able to sell it and gotten the body only just fyi i know zzz i mean it comes with every fucking camera sigh not if you buy body onyl only* the body only prices aren't very good either, though that was the downside kevin can we play something lmao what do you want to play icd idc :league: :camera: :poop: this lens looks p solid :shit: Low depth of field for that ez bokeh yeah idk i like being able to adjust zoom im looking into a lower fstop camera thats like 18-50 but its tough to say ez bokeh is best bokeh but it's p easy to get good bokeh effect from the lens kelvin has and also would have the benefit of being 18-200mm yah whats b okeh wanna just tgta? ???? im on skypes Ayyyyy :dank: fuckin jimmy john's so real Just got my first legendary Motherfucking Harrison jones lmao LOL that's not a bad one it's a pretty decent tech card nowadays also that was kevin's first legendary too Wow we're basically butt buddies :sunglasses::sunglasses: :heart: lol wow yeah a lot of decks use it but it isn't like a staple part of most decks :confused: It's ok.

Probably Netscape how's their JS execution speed? #dankscape Idk about js benchmarks /giphy Netscape Look at thAt quality Holy shit I wonder if that sites still up Nope the ending to this is pretty strnk FINALLY lol wut Does he ever kill aku? it'll be revealed in the next issue on June 3rd samurai jack was pretty bro you guys think I should go downstairs, get a bit drunk, and watch a lot of archer What happened to the TV show? I was actually really into it lol it got canceled before it finished Damn It was one of my favorite shows So fucking badass when he fights those blind archers holy shit my little mind couldn't handle it if only they had actually concluded the series but it was a little too mature for most of the audience on cartoonnetwork That was the dream I suppose But as a kid id never been more engrossed by a show why not read the comics now? put the whole series to bed? Dayum I might I'm afraid I'll go full weaboo lol samurai jack was an american invention shit that was a good game what happened? ayyyy fuck harden :rocket: got rekt :rocket: :gun: :rocket: :gun: damn :rocket: :bomb: :boom: :rocket: :skull: /giphy sportsball wow do you not watch sports either novi was a fucking autist and is trying to transition to normiehood what the fuck is it with frat bros and not watching fucking sports exactly part of the transitory steps dude a lot of my bros watch a ton of sports I just don't whats wrong with you ^ autismo ^^^^^^ sports be boring yo of course if you don't get invested in anything it's always boring yeah and I don't have a reason to be invested there's no reason watching LCS should be more fun than watching sports for the most part and you occasionally watch LCS lel dude I never lived in a place long enough to like a place's sports team yo yoooooooooooooooooooooooo well now you can root for the bulls (who already lost) yooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo and the cubs and the bears i fucking lived in the bay the warriors blew absolute dick yeah fuck that and now kevin roots for the bears for 15 years and the cubs YO we did fine in 07 i had no reason to like them either at some point you just have to want to watch a sport becaues you want to be part of the atmosphere and all the fanfare that surrounds it and if you don't wanna be a part of it, that's on you do that for the bears but to say sports is just outright boring seems incorrect you already fit in kevin by hating on cutler :^) I mean I can watch sports and be fine and it can be entertaining at times depending on the game that was a good ending to the game. kevin i mean obviously watching sports doesn't mean you have to watch every minute or every game :bear: but just to have a small investment in some team enough that you somewhat care about their success brb going home lets play somethin and not really had to stay late to do some failovers and watch the game. I guess maybe I'll follow sports more once I start working idk iono man maybe it's 2 late 4 u coudl be forever autist :^( I mean if I feel like it's really holding me back I'll just study up on chicago teams or something dude it'll hold you back guaranteed but by how much idk i mean i follow sports kinda and i already feel held back because i'm not a blackhawks fan or not held back no one at the office is really a hockey fan but it's disappointing to walk past bars and shit when blackhawks playoff games are on and then not be a part of it because idk shit about hockey or the blackhawks wut you can still walk in there and just chat about other shit there's a large percentage of people in there that are only half interested thus far I don't think it's held me back at all nah, i just think that's lame what do you think a large % is? like 50% aren't interested in the game? like around 40-50% could talk about other shit if you broach the subject properly and then they'd half watch the game and half talk with you i'm sure they could, but even hypothetically and you can do the same if you were at my place and i was watching the warriors game i would not talk to you about anything other than the game and basketball in general and if it were a some game i wasn't really invested in like the atl/cle series i still wouldn't talk about anything other than the game :confused: iono maybe that's just me perhaps usually when you're watching a game with other guys it's with close friends and in that case idgaf because there's a lot more there to be done and I can drink and watch a game just fine (been doing it for years at the KDR house0 and in the case we're not good friends I probably wouldn't be invited over solo to watch a random sports game (superbowl, etc... are different beasts) so if you were to pick between watching some NBA playoff game or TSM vs CLG what would you pick? the latter i would pick the nba game 10 out of 10 times lol that's just the difference between us and it's not a big deal but i don't understand why you'd pick the TSM CLG game what is your reason? I just don't find watching basketball that interesting like what makes that more appealing than a basketball game or any sporting game no i guess this is pointless I'm more invested in league and I understand it at a much deeper level than I do basketball i suppose the real question is why did you never get interested in any sport at all regardless of the fact that you moved a lot I didn't really have anyone to watch it with your dad didn't watch? and the kids I hung out with didn't talk about sports for the most part :disappointed: he did, but not like all the time and he never told me to watch with him damn yeah i mean kids back in like elementary wouldn't talk about sports or anything either with me my dad would watch games when they were on, but maybe like a couple of times a week and i'd just sit down and watch with him wait wtf kevin ? we definitely talked about sports in elementary school in elementary? i don't remember any of that what the fuck were you dropped on your head? in middle school? i also didn't hang out with you wow 2 cool 4 me lolol :(((((((((((( oh wait no my b i guess i was thinking like 1-3 grade 5-6th grade started talking about it more 4-6 yeah okay thats what i was thinking my bbb were you always interested in sports kelvin? REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE GET OUT NORMIESSSSSS we have two huge faggots who don't follow sports here and guess what they're both IMSA kids smh NORMIES GET OUTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT a lot of people at IMSA didn't talk about sports haha i mean that kinda makes sense given the nature of the school i'm sure like my friends actually talked about sports lel 90% of IMSA students would be like the attendees at MineCon :^)))))) dedotated wahm i watched sports but i wasn't a die hard fan since i didn't have too much time but since i have a lot more time now i watch / follow more closely you didn't have time in elementary school? :disappointed: no college i remember back maybe around like 4th grade or so i was SUPER FUCKING MAD that the florida gators beat some i forget LOL what the fuck? iono why i was so deeply against the gators lmao was it the illinois illini? nah it was like a big game so not illini cause they suck :^) the bears :^) :)))))))))))) it may have been a CA team wtf how did you do that have slackbot talk to me ;^) GOD DAMN my dad was right this kirkland signature small batch bourbon is pretty stronk this fucking alcoholic always disappearing amidst important conversations about why he doesn't like sports to go and drank :^( why aren't you dranking? tomorrow is Friday because i don't like dranking :confused: it's Thirsty Thursday lrn2drnk dnt_b_btch i can drink just fine but why would i drink by myself and i just simply would by default not want to you're not unless i had a compelling reason you're drinking with us noice soon you will be hangouting with me naisu :simple_smile: noyca x) kelvin do you remember this dunk? :simple_smile: Dude I'm.

Lel no just because our interests are so multifaceted as opposed to you and your neckbeard only interests :simple_smile: dammit kevin i wish i could know as much as you I'm interested on party life and edm yo no you're not you just do that as a front Pls you know the only thing you want to do is play hearthstone solo Q and watch LCS come on be real have you rolled before rolled? :disappointed: idk what that means if I could do it with a hot bitch without pretending to be a normie I would i was asking novi Nah I haven't I've been pretty straight edge with drugs i hear it makes edm concerts a lot better Not that I have any problem with them I'll probably do it within the next year I was going to earlier but our supplier took all of the molly himself lolol damn i haven't really done any drugs not like you cool kids me neither :disappointed: kelvin let's go to CO or WA ;^) I can get you some dank kush if you want? We can all get high together and listen to Marley i feel like if given the opportunity to just get it legally, i would rather do that i would imagine the stuff you get legally is better, too But you might not like it Yeah the quality is a bit higher You can sometimes get shit weed here But I'm far from an expert on the matter yeah iono i'm not really interested in tripping balls getting high maybe wait really? i heard that stuff legally isn't higher quality ive only ever been drunk before i tried weed and so i never actually felt the effects Weed is better when not drinking Smoking tobacco is the way to go when drinking interesting well maybe at some poin i'll try weed without being drunk. You get more happy and giggly Or at least I did Oh and horny And hungry I masturbated and then ate Cheetos True story am i not cool if i don't want to be a druggie? :disappointed: You aren't cool, yes All the cool kids abuse substances huehuehue will people not like me because i would rather be relatively str8 edge? :disappointed: Lol weed isn't that big a deal It's basically alcohol But it's fine not to do anything other than drink People are cool with that but what if i just don't wanna be poppin' molly and shit? :disappointed: what if i don't wanna snort cocaine off of a hooker's ass?

It's the best shooter of all time mang Probably honestly a t1 micro instance on ec2 lmao Or if need be a higher one Essentially just turn on the instance when we play and leave off otherwise you prolly won't need more if the game was made in like 2003 Cheap af how much do you think it would run you? If I don't leave the server on always and only when we play? Lol gotta love compute cloud prices Hosting on US west at the level 2 tier is 3.4/hr Lol US east is 2.6 lel so real we'd get better ping in chicagoland with US east fuck the califags :^) Yeah what butt blasters if the game was released in 2003 I can prolly run it on my laptop np unless the graphics have been updated or something since then Nah That's the best part You can play on whatever at a high frame rate And it doesn't look like shit either we're going to copenhagen kevin kevin kevin what about minecraft? :^) Duh :) i meant can you also host minecraft? Sheet yeah minecraft We should totally do that together But it'd have to be on for longer Yeah of course I meant if we have an ec2 instance Why not host both? :) You ready to be a sysadmin Kevin?

Should be easy using existing ocr tech true but what about dank memes that are only images We'll leave that for a future paler Paper Ezpz lol aite noice Dr. Dank, Ph.Dank we should figure out what mods we want to play with for minecraft :simple_smile: idk why but im pretty excited to play mc again...

Yeah you've gotta go be normal I understand fuck you novi be a normie kevin what should we do today relandscape? :simple_smile: what do you mean relandscape? like terraform our surrounding area to make it look nicer / flat? i think we should get rid of the back hill area so we can have a nice backyard and its also a slight cliffside so we can have a pool overlooking the mountain but what if we want that cabin in the hills kinda feel? we can't have that w/o the hill behind :disappointed: we're still in the mountains though okay fine but we can make a pathway out the back and still have a pool we sound pretty autistic man no. why is this being autistic fuck the sgs6e's thumbprint fingerprint authentication is so bad lel :confused: should've got an iphone6 i'm considering at least asking for a return you've tried the iphone's right what did you think about that it's OP af fingerprint auth :^) apple is expensive as fuck this one is like but the experience MOST of the time is top notch 50% of the time OP af i can see why on the notification drawer 50% doesn't work properly LOL the only time the apple one doesn't work is when my fingers are wet but i think thats understandable. which is prob pretty uncommon anyways and also another thing is this sgs6e isn't stock android oh so its notification drawer is kinda shittier its samsung ghetto version touchwiz, what samsung calls their android 'skin', is a lot better now than it used to be but still not stock android zzzzzzzz why they gotta be cool like dat? android oems man they all suck except for OnePlus :^) ayy lmao why they gotta be cool Man I wish I could be playing swagcraft with y'all instead of sitting in a car and run their own os? Lol we aren't playing right now we're at work damn kevin if we had mods we could let the server be running I remember htc used to have a god awful custom android ui and then get a quarry system and automatically have it mine things for us instead of having me go into the coal mines strip mining for diamonds lmao novi i remember your shit phone with the fucking lockscreen with silly icons that you gotta slide a fucking ring around while you go and become a home decorator or some shit it's okay kelvin, we can play vanilla like this :simple_smile: except for the map map is OP LOL i don't know how helpful it is besides like if we get close enough to each other i can change the scale of the map to be bigger its not that many blocks oh i see but then i gotta restart the server what if we lose all our progress?!?!!

You're welcome Kevin Idk after using this I really can't go back to a smaller phone lol It's so nice having all that virtual real estate yeah the sgs6e is kinda small :disappointed: i personally think its a bit large how large is the sgs6e? its only 5.1 inc which is much smaller than the ip6+ or nexus 6 oh its the same size as an ip6 yeah but ya i know about the double tap home but i thought it was still slightly big to use for me , but maybe ihave nt used it enough i would also think its slightly too big i tried using it like to comfortably type stuff i would always need two hands ya that was my main issue with the bigger phones i like being able to type with one hand comfortably i mean with the OPO i can still type with one hand ezpz because swipe is OP ya i mean with swipe but iphones don't have any keyboard that supports swiping zzz well i mean i tried the nexus 6 lol it was still annoying to type with even with swype ... wut really? no keyboard that support swiping? fucking dumbass kevin shu oh my b i fucking hate swype though so i wouldn't use it anyways just use switfkey its on ios too i think maybe the ios version of swype is okay zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz fuck phones swiftkey? let's just all get flip phones why not use swiftkey kevin likes the google stock keyboard i think lol kevin just become like mkbhd and swap between all the phones nice X) X) X) X) X) get an ip6+ , sgs6e , opo2 , everything lolol google stock is pretty decent google stock is the only good android keyboard imo i like switfkey about the same as i do google stock i liked it enough to swipe on it google stock sucks for typing yeah apple stock is better for that i tried compared to ios stock yeah for a while and gave up and started swiping ios stock is OP for regular typing and started liking swiping actually i wish ios stock could swipe though, that would be nice mm apple would prolly do it pretty well too if they end up doing it i would imagine typing on the ios stock is ridiculously accurate compared to most other keyboards i think so i'm sure they'd make swipe also really good i wouldnt be surprised if they add it in the future kevin get an iphone :^) then i can imessage you :simple_smile: exactly!!!! black or white space grey kk we can be iphone bros :^) i'm on it bby lol wut thomas just called me ?? he didn't call me :disappointed: idk he instantly hung up :disappointed: damn thomas is clearly getting it on and just buttdialed u but also insta butthangedup on you :^) :cry: Ayyyyyy jason why wont you play with us ayyyy tlaister is back lel lel Lel idk what you're talking about mang lel yeah i don't see it bwei dunno lel if you wait a second it tries to replace lel with jasons's lel ayyy lel i don't see it mang ayy lmao kevin are you still at work yeah :^( working on doing some pullups :^(^P(^P(^^(^(^( dammmmnnnnn so im assuming you got dinner free dinner! no i went home lol using the pull up bar i got shit is 2 hard lolol im watchin the warriors game 2dank4:square: lel dwight howard practicing free throws nuhhhhh They undelayed my flight by a lot I'll be back sooner now NICEEEEEEEEEEEEEE MORE AUTISMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM yesssss :heart: HARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRISON BARNES wtf bogut has 8 boards 6:01 into the game wtffffff FUCK THE WARRIORS WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING!?:!??!

Cuz if we did end up staying at your current apartment complex then I'd rather just split your place now so I don't have to move shit but otherwise I'm thinking of taking up navidoops offer ;) we have to move regardless because we wouldn't be staying in the same unit it would just be a little bit less of a hassle to move Yeh What time will you be going to work novi? I'm starting June 8 So I'll be moved in next week When do you start? I mean when in the morning do you think you'll start your average work day July 6 Oh I mean I'll try and be in by 8:30 Ok But it's irrelevant since we'll have different bathrooms You'd share one with minjae And you need a sub letter for June July and August? Oh that's not a problem July and August would be fine too I was just curious so we could have a bro commute :) Our other renter already paid for June :) Ohh ok Damn Aight ya So it's p flexible You can move in whenever Is this ok with you kevinchan yeah ofc i'm not gonna be mad that you have a better option lol but don't get rekt by the noble square commute bby It's a 20 minute commute via bus to Belvedere The stop is one minute from the apartment So we wouldn't actually be commuting together as I'd take the blue line Aight you sure though? I really don't mind sharing a place for a couple months cuz that was my whole summer last year l and I know you're paying that ungodly rent. What's the address novi? i mean it's not really a big deal to me it's 3 months of rent, which isn't chump change, but having more space for myself isn't a bad thing either Aight The address is 1449 w Augusta blvd The place is closer to restaurants and bars than it seems Lots of options within 15 min walking distance Aight I'm really on concerned about transit in the morning The rest is what ubers for haha Transit in the morning should be good. The bus to your office comes every 5 minutes The area isn't super crowded so there should be space on the bus Regardless it'd only be a 2 month affair flyover state IL? :disappointed: :airplane: :il: Wat :airplane: :cal: :airplane: :il: :airplane: :enova: :airplane: :office: :illuminati: effective. Power gamus? agor,io? is anyone here? yeah i mean anyone with a green dot is here just not doing anything we should do smoething no one to do anything with :disappointed: are we just missing bomdica i mean he said he'd play in 45 minutes 30 minutes ago but gary isn't here he's on his laptop in Utah or w/e o so we still dont have a 5th and idk how stable my internet is i have no idea why im losing packets get fukt like i reset my router like twice already i dont know why im being shaffted it's not a router thing it would be an ISP thing not familiar with how it works so is it comcast? comcast/riot iono its comcast cuz its happening on all my things does it have to do with getting a new modem or something cuz they called about that a few times maybe? i mean i'm not a networking expert so i'm not sure yeah im not either and its really frustrating this channel so ronery without the working ppl here :disappointed: I just had my first talk with my future manager seems like it should be bro work but looks like my main coding partners are all gonna be shitskins like me :disappointed: do you have any idea what this bug is? i found this lil mofo on my leg today while in the shower and i tried flicking it off at first and it wouldn't budge so i had to like detach it from me which actually took a decent amount of strength to pull off oh shit nigger how flat was its abdomen? i don't know i just got it off and tossed it into the toilet it's either a tick or a bed bug i doubt it's a bed bug yeah I think it's a tick all of my shit is new how the fuck did a tick get into my apartment building because it has longitudinal grooves on its abdomen and not lateral oh you could have picked up the tick somewhere outsdie i know but it seems like odd timing because of a certain dirty indian man staying over ;^) gg i have lyme disease now where on your body did you find it? oh it's definitely a tick btw since it has 8 legs yeah it looks like this tick is a larva or maybe a couple of stages past that it was pretty small also didn't look like a deer tick so iono if that means anything am i GG'd? prolly yeah it was good knowing you :disappointed: :disappointed: but actually do i need to care i mean nothing hurts I think you should totally be fine there's just a red mark on my leg should fade within a few days to a week lyme disease is pretty much only contracted from ticks in like the deep woods and shit yeah that's what it seems the CDC's website is saying also the mark on your leg is in a bullseye pattern which for me it's just the red mark where the bite was unfortunately u ain't gonna die nigga yeah i fucking h8 life why couldn't the world just kill me? no gf :^) i bet you brought in this tick you fuccboi gave the tick lyme disease and everything well guess what nigger i ain't gonna die like this if i'm going down i'm going to bring a tick to your place too and have it bite you too :^) mutually assured infection eh? good thing I've already injected my dick with antibiotics your lyme disease is powerless against me it's okay i gave my tick syphillis i'm actually p surprised at how much effort it took to remove the motherfucker they latch on pretty hard mang and syphilis is also treatable with antibiotics... TREATABLE NOT CURABLE GGGGGGGGGGG unless it is curable i have no idea ...it's curable... i just try not to get STDs in general ...u dumb shit... most STD's are curable p-pls p-p-pls novdip i'm s-sry i don't kn-know about all these c-c-c-cool STDs like u senp-p-pai you gotta get your head out of your ass and into a pathology textbook Nice novi you saved me from Kevin's infested death trap fuck you shil, novi brought this tick in it was all a ploy to get you to live with him instead because he's jelly of the connection we share the tick is the least of what I brought there :^) I brought the curse of the curry smelling household soon all your belongings will smell as thought they are suffuse with ancient eastern spices and your neighbors will complain about their pungency Feels good to be wanted /giphy feels good you given any more thought to the matter? Ya dude I'm down So long as Kevin's ok with it OK, I'll tell the guy who's subletting the room that I've found someone for him Cool. When's the first payment/who do I pay? first payment will be due before the start of July, so sometime near the end of June you can chip in for utilities later, and they won't be that much (like $50-$70 I'd guess) and hmmm you could pay the landlord, but you're not on the lease so idk what he'll think of that you could also pay me and I can pay both your rent and mine together did you want an official sublease contract? because I'll have to talk to the landlord about that Na id rather just pay you But ya just lemme know like a week in advance and I'll write you a check or something coolio I'll check with Morgan (the roomate you'd be subletting from) and ask him if he'll have a bed and desk in by July, which he should since he's moving some stuff in this week if you want you can move a bunch of stuff into the place so it's more convenient for you to move elsewhere in the city the apartment has a ton of spare space one thing to note is that your room is best suited for a full size bed since it's not the largest, but you might not have to buy a bed immediately as I've already said shil just gonna move his futon so nbd kk Sup how's work i'm the release pilot :^( /giphy plane crash basically Kevin's experience as release pilot lmao Ecks see fk u scandinavia bois damn dude tough life kevin 2tough when does your release happen?

Total oh fuck you novi you're going to think of something to blow money on yeah I'm down for that we'll drink like kings Yesss i mean we're gonna blow $500 or so on dinner After we blow three hundred on alinea so yeah maybe don't forget the drinks mangggggggg idk how much more that would make the bill I'm getting off the bus lol So I'll talk to you nigs later k see ya man I'm talking with Minjae about utilities shit and responsibility shit and he's half flustered by all of it do I have to be the man of the house? who managed the utilities and shit in your old apartment kshu? you mean at school? yeh gary had his name on everything but it's not like he managed anything just set autopay gotcha and then we work out the $$ later and in the end we didn't really divvy up the costs or anything it was more like over time each of us three probably spent within 4-5% more or less compared to each other so nbd yeah nbd also I've been talking with people in the office some of them are living in River north like we didn't even split the cost of rent the way we should have if we wanted to be "fair" they're paying like $1200-$1400 for studios we just split it evenly three-ways why you getting ripped off bby? i could have lived in a $1400 studio but those are shit like i get that i don't really need that much space oh lol I didn't know but it's nice to have the space didn't look at studios my place is like ~650 sqft not sure i'd want to do like ~500ish ya feel? I feel I feel it all not only that, but i think my studio is overall nicer like more recently renovated than many of the other options gotcha fuck like i just looked on domu found a studio for $1350ish/mo ~430 sqft !!!! too small imo? yeah that is pretty small but it is livable like when i was looking i just really didn't want my bed to literally be in the same room as the living room that's fair like i still have a "bedroom" kinda w/e i'm probably going to buy a place a year or so from now tfw homeowner :simple_smile: it'll be nice get a lot of insurance for the place and I'll burn it down much cheaper than renting i think is it? by much i mean like depends on how nice of a place you get maybe the same lel or how many bedrooms maybe ~$200 more or less well it certainly won't be worse at the very least payments will go towards building my own equity right? instead of literally just all of it goes to someone else and none of it back to me like maybe 60% of my monthly expenses that are property related yup will go towards paying the principal of the mortgage the rest for interest and HOA which is sure as shit better than 100% of it going to someone not me lol 60% might be a bit much wait nvm based on the mortgage calculators it's too little yeah if anything too little lol maybe like 70% I could see that depends on a lot of stuff but then again interest compounded over many years can be quite hiugh *high depends on the interest of the loan you're able to get yeah but these calculators give you an idea of how much to expect i'm trying to aim for like maybe a 20yr fixed @ 3.5 3.5 is p good i think that would be solid 30 years right now are around 4 15s are around 3.2 3.1 but the monthly for a 15 might make it a little cost-prohibitive to buy so maybe a 20 would be a solid middle ground but idk shit about this stuff i'm just guessing yeah this is all too speculative need to hire JDs dad :^) you haven't really looked around much lel i've looked a fair bit just randomly at night idk if he would take you on as a client 2poor prob I'm 2poor too it's okay maybe later if we get married doe then he might be interested dat combined income you're staying in chitown 4 reals? there's great opportunities here btw let me know when you guys wanna quit your silly tech companies and join the dark side :simple_smile: you can be like me and have to get to work every day by 7:50AM (: But retire at 40? I'm down eh I get to leave around 5-5:30 9 hour workday not too bad Holy shit That's a life decision Kevin Too cool for me We at our hostel now why you guys so opposed to waking up early :disappointed: if you guys got to work earlier I could chat with you guys more since you guys don't get active until real late :((( I get in at ten!!! Everyone else just sleeps in Cause they were in school 10 is still more than 2 hours after when I get in pls wake up so early that you can see the sun rise and see the dew on the morning grass and see the beautiful cardio bunnies getting a run in before they head to work there are cardio bunnies at all hours of the day mang :rabbit: part of me likes waking up earlier no you don't it makes it seem like there is more time in the day :disappointed: you caught me :simple_smile: I'm secretly super salty I don't get to roll into the office around lunchtime i mean you have less time at night then bby i got in at 1:20 today #swag jk, only because i WFH from 10 to like 12 then showered, ate and headed in dis guy is that not okay? :confused: so you're gonna leave around 6:30-7? :confounded: nah it's fine as long as you get your work done who cares? i'll probably leave at like 5:30 there's nothing for me to do today slow day I feel ya what about you? wanna grab food? idk if I wanna stay until 5:30 oh i'll leave earlier then nbd I'm pretty much out of things to do today yah lol yeah we can try and get food when did you want to head out? hrm i'd say like maybe around 5 ? you? sure that works for me I'll just keep watching financial theory videos maybe i should refactor code yeh boi or you could watch financial theory videos too :simple_smile: dank would probably be kinda helpful to learn maybe i should watch screencasts of UI stuff :O that wouldn't be too bad also I think having a basic knowledge of financial products and how they work is good life knowledge what do you mean by "financial product" can you define all of these terms for me? securities, equities, swaps, indexes, forwards, futures, options? and then tell me how they work? basically all of the common financial instruments i can't really define them, and i guess i'd only really know generally what indexes, futures, and options are that people invest with and trade on getting a working knowledge of basic financial products doesn't take long imo you can just go online and learn that ish, or read a book I know khanacademy has some basic finance videos then we can be dank theoertical financial speculators togethers make everyone else jelly can we just walk around texas/oklahoma and try to find oil fields? that no one has developed? and become oil barons? except that the government often owns mineral rights even in private property for instance in Cook county you only own your property to a certain depth after that the government has the right to any kinds of resources there it might be all of Illinois and not just Cook county i'm not sure how applicable that is to everywhere because i remember reading/hearing something about how that kind of "depth" stuff was a chicago thing because of all the railroads and shit that are under the city oh that makes sense also I think that basically all coal and oil deposits on the mainland US have been identified by this point or at least a huge percentage of them we gotta go exploring mang there's bound to be riches out there for us :^) should we get dowsing rods? that's how people find oil and coal deposits right? or is it just underground water? i don't really know maybe this is too hard for us maybe we should just waste away our lives in Minecraft and find diamonds there instead what you in the mood to eat novi? p much anything but preferably not too far from my office actually I wanna get wow bao lmao okay that works for me it's kind of funny I haven't had a drink since moving to the city on Sunday been too busy and Minjae wasn't in the mood to drink wow bao closes at 5:30 the one in my building rekt we 5 it is that's when we leave lol yeah and we're both like right there so we can still go and get it alright, imma head out see you at wow bao aight i'm wrapping up something real quick so i might be a little late Kkk imma just order then You guys are so cool I wish I could live in Chicago And be super cheap sup guyz fuck finals let's quit our jobs and make a hedge fund startup that invests in the U.S. Total Stock Market And outperform every other fund (: Tfw it's actually that ez where is errone work unlike you :stuck_out_tongue: last night was pretty bad I've been struggling to get through the day today because you fucking suck at drinking responsibly you alkyhawlik i drank just enough to get to the point where i'd laugh more at things and probably say stupider things than i normally would man the drive back to my place was what killed me if we hadn't driven I prolly would have been OK, but that's a moot point anyways, I'll drink much more responsibly, I just wanted to go HAM for once Too bad we had to drive Unless you wanted to walk lol definitely not lol, which is why my comment was moot Damn you guys go too hard Why can't we just uber ??? because i wanted to drop off my friend novi and make sure he was okay instead of letting him get raped in an ber :disappointed: kevin facetime me no fuck oyu :^) heading home tom did you buy CS GO? @numba! I just got rekt while parallel parking :( I'm not a city slicker yet how? Took me 3 tries you shoulda just did the 180 drift park daayyyuum lebron just got shrekt ayy shil lmao warriors in 6 :simple_smile: ya dude im rooting for them cuz fuck dellavadova i'm actually starting to like delly a little dude's got heart that's about it but yeah :^) lolol nice that's dellevedova right? ^ yeah basically same person kevin get on league idk man i can respect the heart but either he maliciously attacks players or just goes full retard and doesn't understand that his body can injure others when thrown about willy nilly meh, i really didn't think that he did anything maliciously maybe the too aggressive part could be true but eh Like I understand the need to be competitive but to completely disregard the kind of injuries you can cause just by diving at knees and stuff? i feel like he's smarter than tha t you're only saying that because he's an unathletic white guy :^) na man he used to play rugbyu You nigs buy cs go??? Is it on sale? if you haven't bought cs go go buy it :csgo: Actually wait until it's on sale As a daily deal or flash deal If it isn't. But it on the last day fug smoked salmon schmear too stronk Ya dude dem lox is always overpowering I actually got a lot of sleep last night tfw you're not constantly tired at work I have a really crappy wireless signal in my room, and moving the router might not be an option. Anyone have any experience with ethernet over coax? example: I'm gonna order one and see how it works Just get a better router ya nignog Man the router was pretty good and Minjae bought it anyways, I got a different model than the one I posted in chat and the ethernet via coax supports up to 100mbps internet, and we only have a 50 meg line so it should be good anyone else having a rather slow day? my manager doesn't really wanna give me too much to work on/explain a lot of things to me until I've had my options training next week as that stuff is really relevant to what I'm doing ye apparently matplotlib can't handle multithreading in python kinda blows Lolol What are you trying to do? im just making like a basic options widget that can compute theo prices/risks and plot them efficiently maybe add some slider action and 3d/contour plotting but plotting itself takes a nontrivial amount of time (not too long but noticable) so i was going thread the computation and plotting and ec etc but apparently after i forked a thread running a matplotlib function, the thread just hung silently until my computer crashed lolol then i looked up some shit after restarting and saw that matplotlib isnt thread safe like what the fuck is the point of making scientific computing graphic library thats not thread safe lmao well, the idea was that the graph wouldn't be constantly updated lol you'd probably have to use a better threadsafe graphics lib to do that kind of work no well pylab/pyplot supports dynamic updates via sliders and such the numerical processing libs themselves are multithreaded and written in C and FORTRAN the problem is apparently that some functions require main in order to be running such as the show function which draws the graph lol but whatever this is meant to just help visualize random shits to help with the trader training lol k honestly, funny as it seems, I think doing the UI in javascript in the form of a webapp might be faster than matplotlib but then I could be wrong I certainly know that javascript can take really fast updates for UI work Ya I was initially planning on writing a django app and draw the graphs using d3 or something like that but im super shit at web dev and i dont know any js :disappointed: :confused: but i actually have #rekt I honestly thought that matplotlib was kinda shit really? what didn't you like about it besides inability to multithread lolol lol well I only ever used it for random class shit in 357 and maybe one other class and I was like it's OK but it wasn't particularly snappy or extensible it just worked well for simple plots, but I don't think it was made for complex plotting well what do you mean by complex? i feel like the quality of the plots that come out is pretty good with respect to its ease of use Well, I'd consider what d3 can do to be complex if I had to make a comparison I agree with your statement, but matlplotlib is in no way in the same league as other graphics/plotting tools well ya but matplotlib isnt meant for the same kind of plotting that d3 is i think for scientific computing it does the job decently well and its especially appealing since it doesnt require too much or any ui experience from the guy writing the code who also probably doesn't care about the way it looks so long as the visualization accurately reflects the data fair enough mang that being said, if you plan on writing a tool for traders that they'd use all the time taking some extra time to make it look nicer goes a long way loll na man this isnt a tool for traders its for the training the traders have ballin as software and visualizers lolol lol are you in training right now or something? or are you prepping for it? na im just bored family is gone for the week and im looking after the dog got myself a fifth of woodford and a six pack thought it would last almost a week finished 1/3 of the fifth yesterday :confused: too gd that shit is really good but 3 pricey just wait till you're a ballin' ass baller making ballin' ass amounts of money then it'll be 1 pricey loll ya we'll see but are you ready to be trashed all week when I move in :simple_smile: f^yeah I got really trashed Wednesday night at Kevin's was just drinking whiskey on the rocks all night I totally underestimated how much I had drank ya dude kevin told me haha puked in the bushes outside of Minjae's place nice keeping the poison outdoors I'm considerate like that so do I just afk and leave now? my boss already left for the day and I have nothing to do lol ya dude its friday and the market just closed so nothing to do cept drink idk if Imma drink today dayuuum arent ctc bros goin out? perhaps but that'd be later today and I need to go do stuff at my apartment I'm not unpacked yet because of weird shit that's been happening with my living situation whats happening? we didn't have gas or internet until yesterday and actually we still don't have gas because when the tech came in to turn it on he needed a fireplace key to verify the safety of the fireplace but we didn't have one so we won't have gas (aka hot water) until next Wednesday so gay jeez thats some shit just boil water on the stove and bathe on the balcony like your forefathers :simple_smile: damn dude the slack is vacant today no gas = no stove shit no electric stove? nope we have a gas stove nice the classic I like gas stoves mang Minjae did bring a water boiler but we don't have any buckets sheeit dude i cant wait to start working been so bored at home since ive been back I read 2 papers and that book that ctc gave you i dont think i'll change out of my robe for the next week lel nice i actually look like a drunk lolol I was gonna say feel free to move into the apartment early if you want can't dude :confused: you remember my dog lolol when does your family get back? next friday they're ballin it up in paris in france not new york lol they're getting ripped off Paris NY is definitely the better value idk dude, with this strong dollar, europe is decent place to travel to right now even so Paris NY is probably the better value it's so shitty they'll pay you to come tfw your tourism revenue is negative :^) ya dude put the team on the taxpayers backs fuuuuuuuuck I should just leave the office I think that the rest of the FOD team is busy today or at least until the end because there was some production issue or something ya dude just gtfo just gonna let the song of the day finish first apparently people who have birthdays during the week get to pick a song of choice that is played after the markets close each day so a different person and a different song each day nice you should pick smell yo dick for your birthday I feel like that might not fit in with the rest of the songs right now "Carribean Queen" by Billy Ocean is playing ya dude the perfect precursor pls it's actually gonna be a tough choice also this song ain't half bad, pretty catchy ya dude that 80' jam I should go walk around and see what other people are doing on the tea *team the other people in my pod are a bit on the more middle aged side and so they're not too crazy also I think that most of them commute from the suburbs and have kids fasho jk I just did they're all actually doing work sheeit dude you were right about this song lolol apparently it was rerecorded for different parts of the world like "African Queen" or "European Queen" it was #1 on the black singles chart when it came out hahahaha ultimate scam is it your dream to one day scam the markets with a brilliant but dickish strategy? meh not really usually when the market gets scammed good enough theres a correction and even if i didnt face trial for my shenanigans I wouldn't be able to realize much profit holy shit novi wtf did you do to me the funkiest shit i ever heard :notes: play that funky music brown boy :notes: dude seriously 80's funk is really good mang lyrically and musically ya man haha but unfortunately we don't have enough coke and baggy pants anymore to recreate such music ya dude and definitely not enough stds what an edgy comment you know what else I love? there are lots of classes and code related to maximum edge ya dude got rake in the edge I can legit talk about being edgy it's great wish I knew more about the mechanics of magic lmao magics actually pretty fun i played a lil with my brazilian friend back in middle school cuz he had a shit ton of cards I heard it's definitely really complex doe like tons of mechanics and shit ya man i mean we never got into any of that cuz we were just boys but i mean there are still huge competitions it's still the most popular card game in the world right? followed by yu gi oh? yeh i think so lel the power creep in yu gi oh is so real I remember when they started making 4 star cards that were like straight up superior to old 4 star cards in every way and then they stopped making vanilla cards now every monster card has an effect of some kind dayum never really followed yugioh you remember fusion? and how it was a garbage mechanic? yeh that no one used ever? except for in the show? yeh they pretty much replaced that mechanic with tuners and synchro summoning which was a lot easier to do and was generally a lot less specific in terms of what was required to summon a synchro monster ohh man ya i remember that shit from the show lolol never really knew what was going on but it was pretty exciting I remember the first time what I watched 5D's the one with the motorbikes it was the first time I saw the mechanic you should go the yu gi oh wikia and look at certain OTK or FTK decks it's amazing how broken some mechanics are Sip Sup Magic is superior It's also great that for competitive there is modern and standard Standard is only the last two blocks And I think two core packs So they don't really have to worry about power creep Instead the most powerful cards are the ones printed most early lol oh i can see that before they had much experience with what makes cards powerful and what doesn't wutchu up to novidoop lol not unpacking I'm just tired and want to go to bed early and then be somewhat productive tomorrow it's that first week schedule adjustment period you? yeh i gotchu chillin at the ballmer peak and writing some more code lol I wish slack had a board with all of our names on it and :dank: stickers that we got through the week for being :dank: because you've just earned a :dank: sticker my friend :') but fuck i have a headache but my mom took the only bottle of ibuprofen in the house probably gonna get some tomorrow lel don't take that with liquor lol yeh so apparently my dad got some high power NSAIDs from India they don't sell them OTC here anymore Lol what does high power mean Just like a higher dose per pill?

I didn't yet pls no spoilerino the ploterino Pls Me neither I just woke up I'm going to work I wish I could watch it at work I pretty much have downtime until 1PM then the classes and homework start T_T Hahaha I hope my laptop is at work... I have downtime until 1 pm That's when my coworkers typically get in LOL 1PM u srs m8? also where else would your laptop be? Yeah... It might still be in SF since I mailed it I'm taking the E line to the World Trade Center!!! mailed it...? be sure to check out the other world trade center buildings I only went to the memorial so far what you're visiting is the one world trade center freedom tower I mailed it since I didn't want to bring my work laptop on my vacation you'll be relatively close to like the Goldman building, the Barclays building, and the other numbered trade centers And my coworkers get in at 1pm because That's 10am pacific lolol that's p funny Yeah... where is the square office in NYC? Are you at work already? I get to work by 7:50 AM CST every day It's 375 west Broadway sorry was in the subway oh so it's a cozy sort of office I see you there grooby lol what do you mean by cozy and i looked so lost someone had to show me around i came in through the back entrance LOL its nice how my badge just works though by that I mean you guys aren't in a huge skyscraper like many offices in NYC ohh yah we're in soho same for the fb ny office 2trendy4me :^) i now have 2k emails to go through are you staying in a hotel? lol before my coworkers get in LOL hahahaha since i have no idea what i should be doing sneak off into a corner and watch GoT apparently it's p gud like a lot of stuff happens I haven't watched it yet but it's what I've heard fuuuu i don't think i should i want to tho yeah I want to do it too but I shouldn't :disappointed: I used to do project Euler stuff in my downtime wow but nowadays I'm just like so kool I just think of the solution and can't be bothered to code it out most of the time a lot of it is just reworking the problem so that it's solved by a conventional algorithm and then it's gg are you on a bunch of automated monitoring system mailing lists? yeah i am so its annoying I hate that shiz so much it just clutters up my inbox and I like having "0 unread messages" ohp I sent you both an invite for kick off meeting tomorrow. It's in the afternoon (evening for Kelvin), so if you're idle tomorrow I would pick off a few bugs in the queue. Happy to help prioritize. i got an email this morning nice so you've got something to do no excuse not to be productive now lol yah... so im still lookng through emails tho some stuff happened so this will be interesting stuff? prod systems getting boned? like publicly "reportedly filed to go public" IT'S HAPPENING and what's the thought inside the company with regards to Jack being CEO of both Square and Twitter? hes confident in our executive staff so he feels that we are okay for the time being while he helps twitter find a new CEO inb4 he leaves Square for Twitter also inb5 he doesn't and your stock options become godly also inb6 both square and twitter collapse and you join me at CTC where we bro out LOL number 6 is where its at when i finally stop looking through the rose tinted glasses of tech and join the dark side in finance the opportunity is so real financial services are like $$$ and GDP kings management and social interaction play a bigger role in getting things done you get to be in cool cities and if you want to transfer into say something like trading it's a lot easier you can go from finance/tech to tech anytime, but doing the reverse isn't as easy yah definitely tfw when sf isn't a cool city :disappointed: tbh feels like you have more fun there if you like to get high all the time a lot of social interaction was mediated by that based on what I saw more so than in Chicago or NYC haha i see i don't get high so yah where are all other peoples sleeping or at work? most of them don't wake up till like at least 11 and Kevin should be rolling out of bed right about now wait really? damn now i know how you feel in the morning at least we got each other for this week :heart: dawww are you gonna be up early every day? and also I won't be able to talk much because I have options theory classes all this week starting today at 1 and then going all day all of the rest of the days Nice how many project Euler problems did you do novi? When my family went to India I worked on that shit all winter break lol I have some tens of them solved, less than a hundred lol well but I haven't done them in a long while i'll try to get in by 10 everyday they got repetitive by 10 lel but thats by 9 for you lol :simple_smile: Ya they were pretty repetitive but by like halfway through the second page they get pretty hard and then after that it's difficult as fuck lol But fuck guys you gotta watch GoT I'll see what they're like when they get to the later problems a lot of the problem is that it takes time to make some of the data structures you need to solve the problems I remember I used to keep a lib of useful functions I wrote I think I only ever used like some kind of modified dictionary lol holy fuck 2k emails is a lot ive only gone through 400 of them I spent most of time on like reworking the problem to be easier mathematically Jeez but what about things like prime number finders, etc...? or graph libs? I guess you don't really need them and you can make them for each problem but it helps to write it once and then use on a lot of problems Oh ya no I definitely reused those functions Didn't really use any graph line Libs** some of the problems can be brute forced but some of them have elegant graph based solutions that use path finding algos and whatnot instead i used dynamic programming but after a few problems, it isn't enough and you have to use a combination of that and actual mathematical simplification to decrease the size of your search space pretty much I'm currently writing a graph lib that's as extensible as possible much thought is going into this nice dude man im already missing the graph theories that shit was a such cornerstone to my education lol taught me how to take the buttfuck while smiling aka how to be a mathematical geisha lol ya i suppose that's what every mathematician aspires to be alright, I think I've got a decent graph lib structure you using python? oh man finally went through all of the email wait so how many project euler questions did you guys do i remember doing it all in python the summer before i started college to get used to using python and did like around 50-60 of them? all through brute force LOL wow that was pretty quick ive done 85 and then got fucking frustrated lol maybe i'll try again brute forcing it is cheating :stuck_out_tongue: you gotta do it the elegant way i was a student straight out of college i mean high school i had no idea what an "algorithm" was you guys are so cool idk what an algorithm is ... goddammit gary why arent you visitin ny He's too busy fallouting in Boston i didn't get to watch the new gameplay from e3 yet so hype btw just wondering was the WTF from the season finale about jon just watch bro pls i just want to know what to expect no dude you cant is it about jon?

I'm just going home first mmk ]: I wish I could get on this illinois hangouting Blazing it up in Chicago :) uploaded a file: for iOS Upload> I wish I could to I just watched inside out It's a pretty chill movie What's it about? Trannies? Dankkkk damn, i missing out on all these bro happenings in chitown :disappointed: We're drinking rye beers Fuck you Gary :disappointed: Computersssssssss ..... what the fuck novi it was a disney movie People tell me I have issues whelp day 3 of jet lag lel why you so affected by jet lag why are bagels delicious in new york Aren't they in SF? idk never had them they're not really a thing in sf because I just sleep whenever it's too hot to do anything during the day anyways ]: wow how long you in tw for? till the 30th oh thats not even that long! when do you start should i buy games on steam im so tempted I'm tempted to get stick of truth and game of thrones telltale series I start on the 15th I mean there's stuff that I want to do but standing in the sun for = melting lol damn how hot is it? 93 with humidity it feels lke 100 Idk if the got game is worth Stick of truth I've heard is great though its $15 for the got and $14 for stick of truth hrmmm Stick of truth the better value damn yeah i guess thats true i rarely play through the telltale i still havent beaten walking dead but that GoT hype Is it even supposed to be that good? eh i heard the first coupe chapters were meh but polygon has rated them better and better It's a bit pricey for everything wait isn't it $15 for all 6 chapters? if its not then fuck dat oh fuck i haven't been keeping up with the steam summer sale i have 2 hours to decide maybe i should just flip a coin I don't think it's 15 for all chapter's I could be wrong For some systems, such as PC, there is no option to buy episodes individually and you can only buy the whole season. so its $15 for all 6 episodes $2.50 for each episode ain't bad Oh not bad then hmm half of the reviews on steam complained that the choices don't make a real lasting difference in the overall game just the tone of characters towards you which after playing Walking Dead, is not that surprising i guess the biggest question is can i wait until steam winter sale That's disappointing when all 6 episodes have completed Probably yeah well i mean I think it's worth waiting theres no way that they can have that many branches they have to write a storyline for each one and then theres no "canon" i may get stick of truth though i heard it was pretty amazing from a coworker Yeah it is Great game you've played it? I've seen some let's plays Looked really fun Great atmosphere aight i'll get it metacritic 85 not bad i also really enjoy south park and holy shit polygon gave arkham knight a 10/10 what the fuck 91 on metacritic right now Wtffff That good? Yeeeeeeessssss arkham origins was pretty shit apparently It was basically arkham city fuck okay i still need to beat arkham city Except city had more fun predator sequences dammit lel SO MANY GAMES TO PLAY wtf do i do Finish city before you buy knight yah makes sense apparently its a direct sequel to city trapped with a monologuing enemy, Arkham Knight doesn't remind the player that they can remotely blast enemies with the Batmobile, the game waits patiently for the player to come to it on their own. holy shit thats fucking cool and im sure at the end of the monologue you just die and you'll be like wtf do i do although i guess thats a semi spoiler shit maybe you shouldn't read that. Lololol Damn I wish I hadn't read that now :disappointed: sorry That game looks dank as hell if you haven't seen some gameplay videos i have not seen any its the last batman game apparently Gamespot gave it a 7/10 :/ :/ :(( Ign gave it a 9.2 arkham knight? I think gamespot just sucks lol i used to like gamespot i loved gamefaqs Gamespot has gone downhill now instead of using gamefaqs there are so many individual websites for each game now Yeah so no reason to use gamefaqs anymore :disappointed: i do occasionally use it for smaller console / handheld games But what about dank .txt guides? dat ASCII art doe 2gud i have 38 mins should i get stick of truth?!?! How much is it? 13? 13 Buy it Can you buy me one too?

My steam account is vallejo314 square cash obv i dont think we're friends on steam lol i'll do that when i get home Kkk We can figure this out later damn, if only stick of truth had co op would've been bro hows boston gary it's aight traffic is p bad though although my commute to work shouldn't be bad weather is nice right now not too hot and not humid have a place now wait you drive?

fucking on hold with the irs now cuz I still haven't gotten my tax return -_- thats why you just pay like 5 bucks to have them electronically deposit and you electronically file so much easier. i did electronically file did it through turbo tax oh okay i did that too i got mine pretty quick like 1 month i did mine in like early feb tho i got a letter a couple months ago saying that they were reviewing my shit for whatever reason and told me to call if i didn't receive it in 60 days damn dat sucks you're actually tax evading lol no dude just the oppositie they're looking into your offshore cayman islands accounts i'm loaning the government money at this point haha actually the swiss bank system just opened for foreign inquiry why do interest rates have to be at all time lows :cry: so they prolly found your secret stash there sheeeeeit you should share it with us. then you wouldn't have to give it to the government :^) nice not on hold no more get yo money back and treat yo self tfw I ave to wait an hour until people start drinking and all I can do in the meanwhile is do project euler problems lol damn too cool nice me too cept instead of drinking i'll be picking up my parents from the airport idk about me my stomach is hurting like a motherfucker what the fuck is going on fuuuuu why maybe the pink eye spread to your belly its my only friday in new york are you on antibiotics for your pinkeye? yes i am or is it just topical antibiotics in the form of eye drops? oh that's why your stomach hurts its topical antibiotics in the form of eyedrops yeah then it might not be the issue if it were consumed antibiotics then it could really upset your stomach potentially yeah, i remember that you should always eat before taking antibiotics is that true for the eyedrop ones no I could explain to you why orally consumed antibiotics upset your stomach if you care to listen I have nothing to do okay i'll prolly read it ive been writing design docs this whole week and designing protos so much joy... sounds like so much fun feels weird that i have to write so much because im technically now the "senior" engineer on the project since the other engineer started the same time as me but she was on a diff team so now shes now on our project lel that startup life when you're a principal engineer less than 1 year in lel a 1k+ people startup :^) well, anyways lel imma drop some science on your ass so first of all it is important to note that a significant part of the digestive process of consumed materials that occurs in the human stomach is contributed to by the natural flora (ie bacteria) found in the esophagus/intenstines many necessary enzymes required for the breakdown or transformation of metabolites are produced not by the human body but by bacteria now, for a moment, let's talk about antibiotics oh it kills the bacteria contrary to popular belief most antibiotics don't kill bacteria okay got it. aww :disappointed: it's a very common misconception most antibiotics are bacteriostatic (inhibit cellular growth and multiplication of bacteria) rather than bacteriocidal and the reason that this is important is that we don't want to kill the bacteria in our stomach that are necessary for our digestive systems to function properly ah so since bacteria have short life spans, if they can't reproduce it is essentially similar to killing the bacteria that would be very, very bad well, no :disappointed: im too dum pls i should give up the thing is that our immune systems recognize and don't destroy a lot of bacteria in our stomach as those bacteria are necessary for us to live and also because the bacteria are kept in the stomach which is not an immunoprotected area (we do not have bacteria anywhere in our body other than the stomach normally) now, a lot of sickness happens because bacteria are in our blood, lungs, throats, etc... in this case the immune system tries to attack the bacteria and kill it off but the bacteria might be multiplying too fast so, we take bacteriostatic antibiotics to limit the rate of replication of these bacteria while not killing off the bacteria in our stomach this allows our immune system to more easily deal with the infection and the reason our stomachs get sick is because while the existing bacteria in there aren't killed they can not multiply properly and so the population and community health of the gut flora go down making it so that we get diarrhea/nausea but can still function that's a decent explanation of how antibiotics work so what do i do now my stomach hurts should i eat am i hungry i dont know lel idk I'm not a doctor sure eat something that would prolly help maybe lol it would either help not help or hurt -_- yeah, basically and I can't offer you meaningful info without actually knowing more about what you've eaten/done recently I ate a bagel and cream cheese this morning for breakfast I drank an oi ocha green tea with it maybe the cream cheese was contaminated with a virulent strain of e. coli? For lunch, I had a roast beef sandwich with a very strong cheese :^))))) i had sour cream and chives chips it's prolly the dairy honestly and i drank hint fizz watermelon flavor it started hurting around lunch time after i finished eating I wouldn't think anything of it it's just part of being human fuuuu i prolly shouldn't drink then should i eat yogurt it has probiotics but its more dairy yeah I don't think yogurt will help eat some tums or something and see if that settles your stomach dammit i don't know where tums are in this office... im so helpless here you sound like a baby but then I remember babies don't get stock options or get sick from milk so I guess you're just a little bitch /giphy laughter im eating a fig bar maybe that'll help oh. my stomach is still hurting :disappointed: i guess i shouldn't drink or should i drink and puke. will that help? alcohol is known to support the health of the body it's common knowledge really i'll prolly puke search your heart for the answer and ask yourself if you wanna be productive tomorrow its a saturday why do i needa be productive go have a drink or two at least that shouldn't be too bad it stopped hurting as much after eating and drinking water great now you're all set to have fun huh i just found out that not everyone uses 'expiration date' its only in North America in british english, its 'expiry date' 2cool thanks for your contribution kevin. it's not affirmative action in the UK it's positive discrimination 3 people were shot at the warriors parade 0 ppl died @ blackhawks rally :il: :ca: doesn't mean they died 0 ppl shot because no one cares about hockey DANK KELVIN CHOU did you watch more TOO COOL FOR HOCKEY nba games or more hockey games let me ask you that :disappointed: hmm? there are actually a lot of hockey fans around here surprisingly i only watched one hockey game i watched the stanley cup clinching game while i was at a bar on monday i was drinkin a beer and i threw up maybe thats why i threw up i saw that the blackhawks won the stanley cup and threw up literally you are just the coolest person ever too cool for hockey you should have visited for the rally yesterday :simple_smile: i missed all the rallys by being in ny it's okay, you have the knicks apparently theres a mermaid parade at coney island tomorrow lel kerr almost went to the knicks i think kerr was originally supposed to and then backed out to join the warriors lmao he was like jk fuck you guys yeah jk i wanna win a fuckin championship why are all the bulls so strong though been to the finals 6 times. won 6 times novi, how do you know so much about phisio his indian parents prolly wanted him to be a doctor :^) :^) doctor parents? lol are you watching any of the parade interivews? no lol let's go to a parade sometime jason :simple_smile: :simple_smile: come to ny tomorrow theres a mermaid parade I'll go for the knicks parade rip never going to NY AYY lmao knicks actually won 2 championships lel unlike the cavs damn friday afternoons OP I'm gonna fuck up my stomach and eat some ramen lolol Apparently there some good ramen near where I'm staying dank momofuku??? just eat tons of yogurt Totto ramen Yogurt will prolly fuck my stomach note More Since I'm slightly lactose intolerant but you'll get more bacteria bros in your stomach damn might as well move to chicago finding housing is rip ok liv wit me? :simple_smile: das the idea or you could move to da bay againnn follow O'Brien :simple_smile: o'brien? the o'brien?

Gross profit margin of 76.7% in the first quarter of 2015 rose 860 basis points from the first quarter of 2014 damn why do you still use basis points might as well do 8.6% lel i have no idea :disappointed: do you even know what a bp is nop :disappointed: ... wait you're kidding me right? why would i kid you just kill yourself kevin will me your opo and kill yourself lol fuck off whats opo? a basis point is a hundredth of a percent yeah i googled it lol opo is the cheap phone i have dont you talk about this at meetings and stuff? oh one plus one i don't really pay too much attn at those meetings ...... and tbh i've never heard the phrase basis point thrown around really? yeah you guys don't talk about like how the business is doing? yeah we do or like measuring tests and stuff but i've never heard that phrase do you ever talk about interest rates? we talk about bps all the time for A/B testing it's always just %'s i feel like you should being a lending company lol yeah i agree with shil here Lel thats weird This is great it's not like i'm on that finance side of it wtf i'm a UI Dev You should know mang maybe for ab testing fuck all of you you still work for the company... lol how come i know this stuff you know a lot of stuff in general .... because ive worked here for a year so you just pick up on stuff as you listen in on meetings or have all hands i've been to 1 of those we've only had 1 so far and during that 1, no one mentioned "basis points" Kevin's just not good at finance and is going to piss away all of his money investing in pyramid schemes :^) oh when did you start? april? no i started 3/2 so i went to the end of Q1 meeting and that was about it ohh okay i see you guys do it quarterly? yeah how large is your company? i haven't really been exposed to that side of the company that much yet ~1k w/ half of them being call center workers wait wtf so corporate is ~500 its smaller than square? i mean bay area companies are expanding a lot more rapidly i'd say so it's not that unreasonable is it? interesting we do all hands every 2 weeks. what do you guys talk about every 2 weeks? just performance and progress reports in general? and just teams around the company present what they've been working on and then an open Q&amp;A with jack / execs well, i guess we have weekly talks in which the whole company is invited and then people can kinda talk about whatever they want so sometimes people will talk about important stuff and then sometimes people will just talk about w/e the fuck they want like gardening and then once a month there's a town hall, but that's mostly focused on the tech dept oh wait, no i remember now i was originally going to go to another one of the company-wide quarterly meetings that talked more about the finance stuff, more than the other one i went to but i had stuff to do because one employee was leaving and i would be taking on his project after that so we were just doing work instead of going to that meeting since that was his last day lol so i probably would have heard more about that stuff at that meeting but i couldn't go ah okay yah a lot of people stop going to those meetings but i think they're pretty important and gives you a better grip on whats happening in the company they're mainly just nice to have yeah, i go to them when i can it's nice to know how much money my project is losing the company :^) wut only because the loans that my project funds are larger than the other products so it takes longer to see the return so we're not just giving away money or anything lol give me money :^) okay start a small business kevin why is enova only worth 600 million i think its so weird cos we're shit i've heard people say that if we IPO'd as a tech company enova has a quarterly income of 24 million we'd be worth a fuckload but we weren't classified as a tech company or something twitter has a quarterly net loss of 162 million but they're worth 24 bil kek novi can you please explain i know there are also other factors like growth rate / target audience but why is it such a stark contrast when twitter is bleeding money because twitter value is purely speculative the only available data that one has to value twitter without any kinds of assumptions advertising potential is by tracking the VC funding it gets they're a public company now. how is it still speculative? shouldn't the public have access to what their numbers are? what do you mean by numbers? like how much MAU they have what their cpa is how much growth they get every month idk but I've read articles saying that these kinds of outrageous valuations tech companies receive without revenue are a result of VC interest maybe that other data is factored in? fuck definitely talking about snapchat not twitter disregard lol lol fucking shil and snapchat ya got super confused when you said they're public lol had to reread oh lol but i think the case is similar for twitter as well the valuation comes from VC interest let's face it guys, startups are just a massive scam run by the VCs probs true but once it hits the public market doesn't that mean the public also agrees with the evaluation of the company? VCs scam the public to too i love odesza :^) what do you listen to kevin right now Odesza but they're too mainstream for gary now aight i'll try listening to them i'm listening to their album "In Return" so you can listen along :))) Ya idk kelvin But there is a difference between market cap and valuation Public opinion matters for market cap but maybe not for valuation? im listening to the spotify top 10 most popular well valuation is before the company is public the market cap is the "valuation" after they go public and thats just the number of shares * price of shares at least, in the tech world thats what people talk about when they mean by valuation like if a company raised $100 million at a 10 billion valuation that means they sold 1% of the company where each stock is based off of the 10 billion valuation wait kevin are you still at work? no i'm at home oh okay im gonna be back home so i can play something today :simple_smile: i'm just chilling in the kitchen seeing if there's any work left to do damn too cool im at work :((( we're doing this integration of our leads system into my team's product right now but i'm not sure how i'm supposed to help :disappointed: wait i just noticed did you actually get hired mainly for UI? i'm full-stack, but i've been doing mostly UI stuff since i'm replacing the previous UI dev ahhh which is cool by me, i like doing UI stuff i would hate to be mainly doing UI stuff :((( but when we're doing this leads integration stuff i'm not sure how to help :disappointed: thats how I feel about UI especially since they're done with the spike i can copy other UIs but thats about it and are actually going to be doing stuff now when you say copy, do you mean take designs from elsewhere and then just implement it? whether it's another site or a wireframe or w/e? uhhh no i meant like we have designs here since we have a pretty set style we have a gem that has all of our css stuff so I just use the correct selectors oh lol, so you mean you just and it'll look nice oh okay yeah lol so like i get a design based off of what it looks like `h1.square-header` :simple_smile: yeah something like that `h2.square-subtitle` but for each ealement element but you don't really fuck with the CSS itself much? well we don't have h2.square-subtitle we just have h2 we're not supposed to fuck with the CSS hmm okay sometimes we do for one off things but then our front end developer i guess that's mostly the job of the designers? gets mad lel like we did one thing completely one off and hes just like fuck this i never want to work in this codebase again fix that shit why he so mad wtf lol lol i think hes dealt with some pretty shitty stuff before he and this other guy made this gem so now all our public facing website uses the same css yeah for my team's product, a lot of the css is built from the ground up so i do a lot of that ish, too especially since i'll be in charge of adding completely new things that there exists no css for and whatever i should still get around to refactoring the CSS because it's kinda shitty right now the previous UI dev had an interesting pattern of structuring his `@media` queries which i don't really like Fuck man my dog is the only one I've ever know that doesn't enjoy going for a walk Literally had to drag him around the neighborhood lol is your dog also fat? or just doesn't like going on walks? Well he's getting fat Because he doesn't like walking lol lol damn that sucks damn lol, i just spent $5.41 for 3 drinks and 2 entrees on `<http://trycaviar.com|trycaviar.com>` :simple_smile: on a new account? maaaaaaaaaaaaaaybe? :disappointed: such scam :^) it's okay that's my last available CC what restaurant did you order i'm not opening new cards for y'all lol then you'll never use it again :((( nah i prob will since they randomly have OP deals like today like would you pay for it normally $5 for entree + drink at Naansense oh damn thats pretty legit i think the normal normal w/o any promos is a bit much i think the normal is reasonable i can't justify not walking 1 minute to a regular restaurant if you order for like 4 people + is what i mean you know? where like the delivery fee yeah then it's solid is divided by 4 and what not but yeah i agree ordering for one its super expensive but since i'm just ordering for myself i should just walk outside and get something lmao my coworker says when he orders from chinese restaurants on the weekends he orders like $30 every time and when the order comes, the restaurant always puts like 3-4 sets of utensils rofl haha and then he eats it all himself and he said that when he gets it he always wonders if he should order less cause getting 3-4 sets of utensils for one person eating is pretty sad Maybe they're provided so he can use all four limbs to eat He's not eating fast enough that's some shiladutulu level bs right there :heart: That's bee-esss :musical_note: Dammit dude I haven't seen any gnarly smoove vids since you left :/ my favorite instance of that of all time mang: :simple_smile: Lol yeh this one is pretty solid too lmao i laughed when i saw it in the video LOL wow dat safety sports sims are the best :simple_smile: i don't get the basktball one the AI is using a retarded cheesy lineup because instead of having a PG, SG, SF, PF, C or some close variant of that they did 4 bigs and a pg? like SG, SG, SF, PF, PF 4 centers yeah no they did 4 C's and 1 SF lol 1 sf lol i mean IRL it would suck whys it a cheese? but in the game it's cheese because you can just randomly get fucked by never getting rebounds or something and then the big men who normally can't shoot suddenly are good at it so it's just all around retarded lol but the AI guys are all on the outside ohh i see lolol i don't get why big men can't shoot -_- why dont they just practice it mostly because they spend their time practicing things they'll use 90% of the time like post moves and rebounding but what if you have a team thats all big and can shoot and rebound!!! lmao, but then you're too slow so unless you had 5 big men who can shoot and rebound and are also fast then you'll still probably lose dream team but yeah i mean it's mostly because they just have different responsibilities the big men who "can't shoot" outside of a game like during practice and shootarounds and stuff can actually hit their shots pretty regularly ahh okay mostly, i'm sure there are still some uber baddies though lel when the warriors played the cavs i don't remember seeing any bigs for warriors cavs played mozgov like i didn't see bogut play at all warriors played bogut like maybe 60 minutes total the whole series lol wait really? prob less actually maybe like 40 i don't remember ever seeing him he had some play time in games 1-3 i think? oh. i only watched game 5-6 yeah since i was in europe for 1-4 they stopped playing him then that's why you want german players so you can use dirk all the time :^) dirk is 2stronk :^) also, did Kerr cheese the Cavs by playing Iggy at the 5? no Iggy was 3/4 guarding lebron Draymond was 5 i feel like the lineups i remember seeing the most are Steph, Klay, Barnes, Iggy, Draymond I can see azalea guarding lebron her ass gives her great positional advantage go away you fucking autist oh right basically smallball = best cheese so it would've been that lineup vs Delly, Shump, LBJ, TT, Mozgod Blatt scouted it after game 4 and still couldn't do anything :^) Mozgod = mozzarella god? Timofey Mozgod :^) LBJ = Lyndon B Jonson? Shump = Shitty Trump? Delly = Darker Nelly? :dank: why not Westmoreland, McNamara, LBJ, Nixon, Abrams wow novi pls stop Fuck remember that video of the Warriors fan asking lebron how it feels to be a pussy bitch? this is hurting my head McNamara sounds like an Irish-Japanese guy You think he's thinking about that now lmao HOW'S IT FEEL TO BE A PUSSY ASS BITCH LEBRON? AYY WATCH YOUR MOUTH WOMAN lmao I can't hear you nah, LBJ's probably just thinking about going back to the Heat but Dwade is going to the lakers or maybe he'll try to sign with the Warriors in the offseason :^) so Lebron to Lakers? Lebron wants to win Lebron to Raiders final championship for kobe? DANK lebron 2 raiders is OP i think Lebron could be a solid WR their lineup would be maybe a TE Lin, Kobe, Dwade, LBJ, Okafor first 82-0 season 16-0 postseason lmao apparently there are rumors saying that LA gives up the #2 pick for Cousins + the #6 pick 98-0 overall lel wat that would be retarded hmm wut why not just get Okafor isn't #2 pick really good theres 2 supposed superstars for this year's draft Twolves already said they were going to draft KAT unless they did it to fuck with the lakers that would be top fucking kek lol "seems like our lineup is rondo, kobe, wade, love, cousins" because while Oka4 is a top prospect boogie is already an NBA allstar and a young one too who is cousins when i hear cousins i think of kirk cousins lol Demarcus Cousins C for the Kings ohh okay i dunno basketball at all if the lakers traded their #2 for Cousins + 6, they could maybe get like Mudiay or something :disappointed: im not cool enough and trade him to another team that wants a G? pls kevin teach me teach me how to be a master of sports knowledge just gotta read /r/nba :disappointed: i read /r/nfl its okay tho niners are gonna win superbowl next year hehe nice jokes :simple_smile: giants won world series last year warriors won nba champion this year next year its niners man or do you think the sharks are gonna win the stanley cup :^) gotta be one of them chicago dynasty mang sharks or niners and the 49ers are a dumpster fire aren't they? lol which one i would pick the niners over the sharks lol hahaha technically the bay area won two championships for the 2014 season :simple_smile: damn detroit won nfl, nhl, and mlb all in one season chicago never has that distinction :^) bay area has it twice danggg oh i thought for some reason LAL gives #2 and their 6th round pick for Boogie -.- #2 for cousins + #6 overall makes a lot more sense and it's myles turner you noob well mudiay is projected 5 so it's not 100% unlikely that he'd be 6 or wait what? mudiay is projected 6 so who's myles turner for? he's like projected in the double digits random blog spam wait what hmm iono, if they get cousins they have a PF/C and then they still have Randle so i'm not sure it makes sense for them to take another rookie C lol people are speculating that they trade randle for the pick idk, it's confusing I just want JLin to play better ]': you Taiwanboiz will never be as good as CN :simple_smile: ]]]]: Yao is OP 1 99999 worse at League worse at basketball can't catch a break :(((( hey you guys got baseball doe :simple_smile: :simple_smile: you mean boringball? fuck which asian country will get good at football first lmao you mean NFL football right? and in that case none cause NFL football sux :simple_smile: nfl football super exciting fuck u why can't Peking University and Qinghua just join the PAC-12 and make it the PAC 14 fuck you novi you're just a general disappointment to everyone jason really wanted to get crunk with you in the city but you REFUSED by being @ home what a horrrrrrrrible person are you a government employee?

yah i decided to get more sleep cause i have a sore throat Damn New York really rekt you lol i think it was just a ton of traveling and yah sleeping on a couch / not used to the huge temperature changes between walking outside and into a building like inside a building its like 70 degrees outside its like 90 Ya I feel ya man Over the summer I always brought a sweatshirt with me cuz I couldn't handle the drastic change haha yeah its so weird i think that prolly contributed its not like sf 50-60 all year round You've been spoiled by favorable climate one of the few nice things about this city You studied cs right? nah even better EECS with a focus in computer science. i took 2 EE classes lel 2 more classes and you get a dual degree why wouldn't UIUC let us do that :disappointed: EECS is the degree program dumbo i already got a dual degree :stuck_out_tongue: its Electrical Engineering and Computer Science :^) uiuc just doesn't have one :disappointed: not coo like UMich or MIT guess we're worse than trash Ah I see Fucking wish I didn't have to waste my time with half the cs curriculum lol Missed out on all that dank probability theory yeah if only you could have done 20 semesters of 427/429 I would've turned into jello from all the gelling which cs curriculum did you hate Really didn't enjoy systems, compilers, and software design so everything :simple_smile: ^ Liked algorithms and and complexity so you sound like kevin okay now you dont sound like kevin i really enjoyed systems, compilers, and algorithms lol i dont know what software design is i just like Cascading Stylesheets :^) Ya I mean I learned useful stuff, at least in systems, but I would've rather spent the class time elsewhere Especially since I didn't go to class lol Yo Kevin is this the last payment we have for the champaign place? i know that kevin thats why you a front end developer wow flying to chicago is only $220 but flying to vegas is $180 -__- fuuu yeah this is the last payment i'm sorry i'm a scrub front-end dev kelvin :disappointed: its diff work you dont need to go to college for that work tho :cry: yeah you should've just got i no :disappointed: a job right out of high school i mean, do you think you need a degree to do most dev work anyways? not really, but each class marginally helps nope i mean you can learn everything yourself nothing hard about that but i guess college just gives you a stamp yeah i feel like it's really only a few core classes that help the most on your qualifications and everything else is just w/e eh really depends on what you work on sure, but i mean like the stuff you're doing like i think gary needed to go to college right now i would imagine you didn't really need most of the college classes you took well not most but systems networking security those were all helpful gary needed to go to college to scam taxpayers w/ his scholarship money sure i don't need the intricate details so he could practice scamming us now but they help you in understanding some of the higher level decisions you have to make ^ that is definitely the main attraction to some of the CS classes just so that in 10 years you have the ability to make a slightly more informed decision i would imagine in 10 years you'd probably have learned the same shit through just working but yeah i see your point at least the same shit, if not much more* ehh unless you go out of your way and read research papers while you're working i sorta doubt that i don't mean like the actual stuff in the class, i just mean the stuff that would be relevant for decision making i'd imagine you'd pick up a lot of that on the job eh maybe you really think it's that much of a maybe? you really don't learn a lot of theoretical running time/algorithm stuff in practice you only learn libs and how well they might or might not work but there are always other people who DO know that stuff but when you're in a higher level role you might not have that to rely on and you learn from them, right? they know it because they read it somewhere or went to school for it the point being that the knowledge comes from the school sure, that's fair yeah no but any ONE person might not need to go there because the herd of people have the knowledge they might not explain their exact decision to you about all the reasons they went through to make that decision and some part of it it that they think is implicit because they learned it in school / reading it somewhere may not be noticed by other people but yeah, i agree with that with enough people someone will have that knowledge yeah i just meant that for that kind of knowledge, you could pick up a lot of it just by asking others around you although it's certainly not as good as just having a class for it but they might not mention something that they think everyone knows just because they took a class or read up on it and thought it was common knowlege like you use a quicksort because its "fast" and you know its n log n for the avg case but you prolly wouldn't explain it like that to a layman you just say its the fastest but then if something that you're working on is mostly ordered then you definitely don't want to use quicksort, because it ends up being like n^2 you just wanna do like a selection sort prolly does that make sense? yeah, no i agree with what you're saying and that's what i meant by "a lot" i guess but not the whole picture yeah, i agree that its different depending on the circumstances and most of the time. school knowledge prolly won't be a factor i guess if you're working with systems that are already in place, a lot of the stuff you'd do is just learning the conventions that have already been set and figuring out how to use existing code maybe if you move into a more high-level role? iono maybe then this stuff is a bigger factor i was thinking higher levels yah fuck, let's just become white businessmen you don't drink enough to do that Kevin i will if it meant i could become a white businessman and you definitely don't drink enough to be an asian businessman :^) i can change novi i promix please just give me another chance?

i mean i like him hes going to a music festival im going to in september i dun normally listen to rap i mean the biggest reason i like him is i like the reason he makes music or at least what i perceive it to be he makes all of his releases free so poor kids and w/e can listen to it or i guess have even easier access to all of it and just raps about stuff that's not just sex/drugs/money/gangs all the time and tries to influence his community like that which is the south side of chicago in general i guess are you sure you dont like him beause hes from chicago? well i heard him first and then the chicago stuff second so i guess it reinforced me liking him I like his back tracks Super groovy yeah, that too it's not like other rap for sure And the intermittent yelling :musical_note: AGH :musical_note: Went I went to Minnesota, chance came on the radio and my friends got real pissed real fast cuz my AGHs were on point :ok_hand::skin-tone-6::ok_hand::skin-tone-6: :thumbsup::skin-tone-6: lmao i see :skin-tone-6: They were just jelly are you using different skin colored thumbs ups?

Gonna be a big success Maybe Navdeeptech? Navdeep capital+ why does it have to be Navdeep in the name To get the ticker NVDP we're not putting that retarded name in the company name your ticker doesn't have to be the same as your company name right? no, but it's much better for it to be similar yeah but we don't care if its better we just want it to be on the stock market and then we dump the stock What about Navdick penis enlargement corporation? Still the NVDP ticker Ooooh Yeah Post ipo bailout it would be pretty solid if we IPO'd and our company's official name was Navdick Penis Enlargment Corporation but we were an alternative to Slack that would be amazing you just say that since you're online its a dick length contest :simple_smile: :simple_smile: and the more you are online the larger your epeen gets fucking novi buying alky @ binny's so fucking illegal i'm calling the cops say guhbye 2 min-j wait is binny's cheaper than other places? i think it is? i mean there's no safeway here, so he'd have to buy it from Jewel Osco which i don't think would be cheaper than Binny's what about costco why is safeway cheaper than bevmo :disappointed: well bois, I got my ethernet over power line kit works perfectly wut is that I might incur a slight ping increase doe whatever man fuck off no league 4 u :disappointed: i should be able to go home early these next couple of days im sick.

I eat apples because health an apple a day keeps the doctor away? i eat bananas and pineapples and grapes and strawberries and blueberries and blackberries Listen to tiesto's club mix for this week because thats what we have at work On sound cloud The beginning has some great songs im using spotify to get my moneys worth :disappointed: that's a p dumb way to look at it :stuck_out_tongue: maybe listen to a kap slap mix and catch up on what's poppin in the world of mashups im not cool like you guys i dont live in a hip happening city like chicago i'll listen to it though. because you even posted it here :smile: shades of grey was a pretty good song that I found by listening to this week's mix subscribe to him, morgan page, and armin for some of the most listened to weekly podcasts whats a podcast i always see them around or people talking about it but i never figured out what it is ..... a podcast is a periodic audio mix/commentary released by someone that one can often subscribe to in order to be updated automatically so named because this type of media was first employed through iTunes/iPods oh interesting idk i never feel like i have the time to dedicate just listening to something idk why i can't do audiobooks but i like to read books podcasts are generally .5-1 hour long and I mean you don't need to subcribe to them to listen it's just a lot of weekly mixes are called "podcasts" yeah idk i guess im just a visual person do you dislike radio? what do you mean by dislike well nvm, i guess you said you don't have time to just listen to something not that you didn't like it oh yah like when im in the car i listen to the radio but idk i just don't feel the same sense of doing something as like when im watching tv or reading a book versus like listening to an audiobook / some radio show like i tried listening to this american life and i couldn't get through it because what do i do while im listening lol i felt bored hmm, well in the car i guess it's different and i tried listening to it at work and then like since you have to drive and you might as well drive and listen i got too caught up and i couldn't do work like i couldn't concentrate on both well, novi's podcast is just like a 30-40 minute long music mix so that's w/e idk if thats weird or not oh yah but if you're listening to a radio show im listening to it right now yeah i guess it's hard to concentrate i mean it's hard for me to concentrate when i'm just listening to rap sometimes is it weird that i cant picture things no, i don't think so? i was talking to people about this and they thought it was weird that i couldn't close my eyes and try to picture something i guess that might be kinda weird this is what happens when you didn't grow up w/ legos :disappointed: So if i ask you to describe what a dog looks like You don't picture a dog in your mind first? kelvin's a fucking cyborg uh what do you mean by picture i have the concept of what a dog should look like Like do you see a dog in your minds eye no? Dafuq wtf does that even mean wtf is a minds eye Damn dude idk how to describe it Fuck ok lemme try and put this shit into words lol lol im so confused people were trying to explain this to me last year too and im just like wtf does that even mena how do you not know what that colloquialism means? no i know what it means but i just dont see anything i dont get what you see well i don't literally see anything Can you think about the visual features a dog may have but if you asked me to picture or imagine like what my bedroom looks like in my mind i would at least have like a mental map of what it should look like Fuck dude kelvins mind is just a huge hash table that skips visualization altogether :dank: what idk i describe it as like i just think of things that describe the object that i should be seeing or what you guys say is "seeing" well, if i asked you to picture like whoever it is you're crushing on is your mind literally blank? no right? what do you mean by blank hmmmmm how do i put this Idk I feel like so long as he can provide a description of visual features then it's the same thing right? yeah i wanna say that he's not really much different at all Maybe but is just describing things in a way that's different but is actually more or less the same like i remember when i was a little kid whenever they like try to get you to picture your house and draw it im just like wtf does that even mean Fuck dude how did you dodge the special ed classes i feel like if you could still just remember what your house looked like and could draw it i mean i had a notion of what it should look like I hated coloring as a kid and I almost got out into those like it was a rectangular box with like some triangles at some places and then some circles as windows Circular windows?! damn, well kids are retarded so what about now i'm sure you could draw me a picture of your house NOW, right? uhh no Gg i dont know real? fuck even i can, u niggnogg wtf of YOUR house no way dont lie you have your garage on the right your computer room/bedroom above it it's inset a little bit to the left you have your main doorway which is very much recessed compared to your garage and then to the right of that you have more house Kevin's actually in your house right now He can't picture things either that' slike a living room area downstairs so there's a fairly large window and then above it there's still another 2nd floor and that part is recessed a little bit compared to the downstairs wtf i'm p sure time to check wut you guys suck at definitions Visualizing something in your mind essentially consists of an awareness of the physical characteristics of the visualized object and how they fluctuate over time in response to internal or external stimuli you're right about whats there wtf fluctuate over time? ^ something that I'd say is an accurate realistic description of what visualizaiton in one's mind's eye looks like novi your definition is retarded :disappointed: pls nah, but your definition is overly complicating it kelvin doesn't even know what visualizing IS at all it seems like when you close your eyes do you actually see anything i just see black no, i don't literally see anything you don't physically see anything well duh but like people say i obviously see the back of my eyelids lol things like sorta show up uhmmm idk how they described it but they said its easier to picture something when they don't have external stimuli rather, what happens is that you put together all of the physical characteristics of what you're visualizing until you arrive at a cohesive whole and you can appreciate how they MIGHT look i just don't get the concept of picturing something. wut thats confusing and this is why your def'n sucks novi lol nigga wtf read my definition and think of it technically It's the same as knowing all the visual attributes something has yeah i agree with shil Or maybe not necessarily all But the important ones Like for a car, you know what the general shape of a car is and you know it has wheels and you know wheels are round etc So if someone asked you to draw a car, you may not picture it in your mind (whatever that means) but you get something on paper that someone else would probably recognize as a car LOL my uh my music disappeared because the link that novi posted is now above the 10,000 message thing :disappointed: okay i can do what shil said Nice cool, so you're not autistic :thumbsup: well, maybe you still are ;^) :thumbsup::skin-tone-6::thumbsup::skin-tone-6::thumbsup::skin-tone-6::thumbsup::skin-tone-6: actually autistic people are quite good at visualizing things Some*** fk you novie you're autistic Most aren't good at anything lol that's why you're so uppity about them lolol I was a bit autist, and still am in some regards but I'm functional so it's aight :^) meh barely novi what did you ask me earlier? i saw a mention, but didn't respond lol and now its gone forever what ec2 instance are you using and how much does it cost? i can't believe we hit the 10,000 msg mark for those servers that i was hosting?

Santon I Fuck D'Antoni no Denver runs a "No" offense :^) denver is almost a dumpster fire mang Ayyyy Idk I think jlin can be a good roleplayer if he busts his ass off this offseason I believe he was already solid, but Byron Scott is OP he had solid minutes when he would play, just needed to limit the TOs a bit but he'd get a couple in some crucial moments and then BScott would banish him to the end of the bench wait when i "wfh" i have to actually be online I mean besides the tankathon weirdness overall so im actually wfh Yea, TOs are pretty big. I think I can see him starting at the 1 Out east :^) it's okay Kelvin just leave your computer on and be "on" :^) huehuehuehue yeah and then i cant respond... i mean if you're actually going to be working until 8 every weekday you really can't do shit so why even bother coming then lol you can only drink and eat isn't that the point? you said you wanted to explore Idk my friend said that he thinks jlin would do well on the Pistons yah so i was going to take which usually means checking out some of the attractions a day off on friday?? i mean or i could just wake up early like 8 and work until 5 lol, maybe that'll be aight iono i mean i guess it depends on or do stuff in the morning i just need to be back to do work by 12:30 whehter you even want to check out like the Field Museum/Museum of Science and Industry stuff like that if you're not interested, then whatever can't do that on weekends? so when are you here again? i don't even remember what the original plan was monday red eye so get there at 6 am tuesday and leave monday 8 pm or so oh, okay then i guess NBD is that stupid? idk chicago that well nah, that should work its like $220 not too bad i mean tehy're just museums so considering my flight to vegas is $180 -_- it's not a huge deal im actually not that interested in natural history museums MSI is cool, Field museum might kinda bore you then and the museum of science and industry sounds like the exploratorium lol or the tech museum i don't really remember those that well anymore :confused: maybe? im more interested in like art galleries... oh, yeah well we're definitely going to the AIC yah sounds good i need to go to d.c. at some point too never been in my life did you get to go to the MoMA? no :disappointed: or the met? i went to the met i didn't have time in nyc to go to the moma i really wanted to go tho next time :disappointed: but moma was $25 lol so i was like next time lol how was the met i didn't have too much time it was very good so many degas and random monets it was so large i mainly went to the art galleries i missed out on the time pieces like its a room set in that time period some of them felt like the palaces in paris or something but it has like british and american stuff next time i go i need to check those out more but i was like all roomed out since i did a ton of that while visiting palaces/castles in europe damn i bet the AIC is going to blow in comparison to the met :disappointed: first city 2stronk isn't chicago like 3rd city the nickname is second city but LA is now the second largest city back from when chicago was actually the second largest city midwest can't keep up with west coast best coast man do people actually consider LA second city? i thought people consider it a bit diff because of all the sprawl i think for tourists the 1st city to visit is nyc then LA have you guys tried the new tavern brawl? oh yeah, tourists prob no it's not as good as last week's but i would still say :disappointed: its still a city hmm, well i've never been to LA so i can't really say much oh so its a deck building one? ...... what the fuck you've NEVER been to LA??? well, to downtown no only to go to like disney and shit i agree that you cant walk to most places but oh that doesn't count thats anaheim yah lol hmm the most visited art gallery in the Us is the met lol prolly i mean it's in NYC after all 2nd is the national gallery of art in dc art institute is behind FAMSF and Getty Museum :((( wtf i can't believe more people visit FAMSF than the Art institute in chicago actually do you think more tourists go to sf or chicago? SF oh you're right. i would say definitely SF by a long shot lol sf is number 5 chicago is number 9 yeah are you talking about just US cities? i wouldn't be surprised if Seattle were ahead of Chicago, too lol they count san jose differently seattle is 17 this is only us cities that's kinda surprising seattle felt like literally only tourists didn't expect it to be so low its a pretty small city yah, but so is SF lolol they're in like the same magnitude of small seattle is like 2/3 of sf in terms of size chicago is probably just 100% devoid of winter tourists so that probably hurts tourism a lot and then it seems like chicago is portrayed in a bad light in the media its a magnitude in diff though like Chiraq and shit in 2013 because of south side shenanigans chicago only has 1.4 million tourists so i wouldn't be surprised if people don't visit sf had 3 million ya nyc had 9.6 lol miami is second with 4.5 mil LA and orlando each is at 3.7 MM what do people do when they visit SF? because of disneyland?? lel like the tourists who go there, probably don't ONLY do stuff in SF, right? they venture elsewhere in CA? like where else would they go public transit sucks in the bay they'd visit oakland? LEL idk, would you count people who are visiting CA in general but spend like a majority of their time in SF as tourists visiting SF? lel out of the top 10 the only one i haven't visited is the one in DC i would say yeah theres a ton of things to see just within the city but ive heard a lot of tourists now also venture south to take pictures in front of google/fb and what not lmao real kevin which of those museums have you visited :simple_smile: i'm not so well traveled like you :disappointed: lel although i guess just 1 trip to Europe could cover most of that list in the top 10 i've only been to NPM in the top10 NPM was :ok: Well to me LA is LA county but kelvin has to have his own def'n mang I think you'd be pretty bored if you had to stay in the city proper i think most people have your def'n Because of sprawl Well Anaheim is in Orange County so Idk I just go there to eat i'm sure i've been to places in LA county lol but i was just too young to remember wait i just know i've never been to the city itself you've actually been to gu gong? yeah i have to see the treasures y'all stole :simple_smile: :thumbsup: The one on BJ sucks (: yeah obv y'all took everything Preserved from the cultural revolution* DANK lol wut we stole? the commies prolly would've just destroyed them STOLEEEEEEEE it was ours and im sure if we didn't move it over the commies would destroy the ones that didn't fit in with their doctrine :disappointed: we're monsters :cn: ok i'm dipping now bbl wow this is late for you PZ when you guys hear quarter of six what time do you think it is?

I can't drink or party excessively :confused: ehhhhhhhh debatable honestly Wowow government funded projects op especially in the netsex community Wait so you're a govt employee that's not on the GS scale? So who's on the GS scale? yeah, i'm not on gs uhhh i'm honestly not sure prob like all actual gov places i'm like at a federall funded research and development center (FFRDC) so we're more like contractors for the gov Ohhh Lol fucking contractors are responsible for all the governments leaks pls leak to us give us some insider info sry bbys no can do i'm not cool enough to be the next snowden :disappointed: you'll enjoy being waterboarded and interrogated by the US gov not nearly as many human rights abuses as say, I don't know, Somalia? lel Gary's gonna set all the admin credentials to admin:password nah do admin:Password that way when they check if admin:password resulted in their leak they won't realize it was Password p dank P4$$wRd that would be a pretty solid password So they know that if they get hacked, it was by a 1337 h4x0rz as there is usually no way to type the euro symbol right? lol w/o doing some gay shit iOS hacking :^) DUH DUH DUH DANK Or on an ISO euro keyboard jason when we doing our startup? :simple_smile: Shu-Wang enterprises? add Gary and you get Wang-Shu-Wang novi what about Shu-Wang-Wang shu singh wang bhattacharyya quigley?

What's nice about tavern brawl is that it's a free pack every week Do you need to win? Idk I won my first time hearthstone is the best: dank what a great spectator experience novi since you're a fucking nerd can you explain what's up with batman vs superman it's the quintessential matchup for reasons I'm sure you can understand and the movie is going to be simplified to hell the real batman-superman relationship is an extremely complex one that has changed over the years but why are two good guys fighting each other at times, depending on the interpretation, their views on how to handle a situation can be diametrically opposed furthermore misunderstandings in tense situations can often lead to confrontations that snowball out of control also mind control should my traps hurt after doing pull ups Yes Also Injustice I think is a pretty cool batman vs superman scenario novi should join a panel at comic con :^) he'd fit in so well with all the autists is anyone here? probably vallejo314 but he needs to add me :disappointed: well he's gone 4 the night oh wut why are you still here i don't have to be in work by 8 lol oh... damn too cool kevin :simple_smile: why arent we playing something? Because Kevin SUCKS kevin, we need to play some gta when i build my new desktop :simple_smile: fuck we should get someone elected to congress and open a shop that only does insider trading because members of Congress supposedly can't get investigated for insider trading? wut no that's false they totally can and also, KDR, my fraternity, is recolonizing a chapter at UC Berkeley :^) :^) is he brown? ...he? oh fuck I read that as someone was recolonizing berkeley for KDR hurr how does recolonization work? fuck if I were still at school I'd be down damn your bros at penn state fucked up recolonization works by having alumni in the area work with some undergrads they know and convince them to join KDR once enough undergrads are there they charter the organization with KDR national and the university it's tough work joining an established fraternity is often more fun, but working on making a strong charter class and using that to get more members is also pretty great life experience also, yeah, Penn State making us look bad they should have covered their tracks better made me think of you, why you linking to a fucking playlist gooby pls i click it and it's The Mowgli's - San Francisco guess I'm useless too this link is the right link lel you guys so kyoot it's a half catchy song lol im having a phone meeting with an outside company its so weird to only have phone and no video phone is how old school business is done video is bad because then the other company sees you drinking and not wearing pants LOL wow maybe thats true the other company was in boston its already in the afternoon for them might as well be drinking on a thursday apparently my coworkers go drinking on thursdays but there's a lecture thing today so no one is gonna go :disappointed: damn what lecture i already drank too much yesterday i threw up again. i threw up cause at the we were at a thai restaurant and we were having dinner with the jp team and we all got a couple spoonfuls of hot sauce + dry spice and ate it in one go Lecture on a particular subject of market making Finance shit And damn you gotta stop puking when you go out :p lol fuck dude i never have a good time when its spicy shit + alcohol its okay no one knew i threw up i think. other people also went to the bathroom. so its not that unreasonable for me to go they all knew you probably had bloodshot eyes and puke breath i always have bloodshot eyes when i drink so that doesn't tip them off and i gurgled some water before i went back what do you guys think of scotus on aca What was their decision? they upheld it I guess I'm for it HBu? they took a stronger position than what people expected they didn't use chevron they used the language that congress probably didn't intend the law to fuck things up so the plaintiffs are wrong i think it was good Yeh this is also an interesting read I'm surprised it took so long after Marbury v Madison for a case like this to emerge oh for someone to challenge the government in something? Lol ya yeah maybe everyone between them was just sheeple Lol yeh I was never into law that much In fact I'm still not But I appreciate it more now that I'm watching west wing hahaha damn maybe i should watch west wing sometime i actually think law is super interesting but too bad i dont like rote memorization Ya dude Really entertaining show the memorization is fucking intense But ya law is for math students who could never understand, just recall lol damn dats harsh The truth often is :sunglasses::sunglasses::sunglasses::sunglasses::sunglasses::sunglasses::sweat::sweat: :cry: :'| :sweat: is alcohol bad for a sore throat? i can't tell from online posts people say conflicting things. It's always make mine worse But maybe it's cuz I talk loud when I'm drunk sometimes? Idk but I'm pretty sure it can't be good for a sore throat lol it's not good for you in the long term because it promotes dehydration which is bad for a sick body but in the short term it makes you feel better i drink a lot of water though it acts as a slight nasal decongestant and the water pull from your body due to the alcohol tends to reduce the swelling of things like which is why your throat might hurt less ah i see interesting coupled with a general desensitization of the body hmm im starting to think my sore throat is from a viral infection from what ive read online dammit why is it so tough getting sick it could be worse lel you could have been born in the 60's :^) lol wut nvm it was a dumb thing to say didn't they have basic medicine back then? its not like the 1800s where they just chop shit off I think that by the late 1800's medical care was substantially better than it was at the start of the 1800's true i think we can say that for the 20th century as well and i hope we can say that for the 21st technological achievements seem to grow exponentially do you think we'll ever hit a cutoff in our lifetime btw, novi i tried to add you on steam last night oh I'll check that later today I need to fix some internet issues first yup i agree with novi oh, lel I 100% don't think we'll see a cutoff in our lives things will keep progressing at an ever increasing pace mmm have you guys ever heard of wait, but why? nope i have just now :simple_smile: fuck you kevin what? :disappointed: i'm telling you i've heard about it now and i'm looking at it read this :simple_smile: but the "just now" is not helpful oh nice we have next friday off go on a vacay :musical_note: me and you should take a vacay :musical_note: #martinsolveig to where do what Mexxxico? hue hue hue can't take time off for a while :confused: you dont have friday off? oh wait you havent started yet pretty sure you have the 3rd off Shil ohh I thought you meant for like a week or something ofc he has the 3rd off he doesn't start until the 6th lol ya and the markets closed more importantly until the 6th shil is a NEET gimme that welfare you guys know he he'd pull up in a limousine and one time a camera crew was there and they asked him why he did it and his response was "fuck the government" truly an hero fuck :gary: fuck :lincoln_lab: :gary3: lol srsly fuck :gary2: gotta take money back from the gov let's promote anarchy so that Gary loses his job we should be tax protestors like wesley snipes we're only protesting gary getting our taxpayer money right? thats what im mainly protesting against everything else is meh okay we just need the whole nation to join together okay how we do that not enough people know who gary is we can start a kickstarter :simple_smile: whats the kickstarter for? are they donating money to go to gary!?!? is this like a stupidity tax see how many people are stupid enough to back the kickstarter? we can be the Washington Redskins :simple_smile: Go fund yourself! can't wait for the new season :simple_smile: when does it start Next year I think :( Or the winter yeah u dumbo bumbo I don't think it'll be for a while :disappointed: awww really? man september 23 apparently i thought it'd be like maybe 5 months from now? yeah something like that stupid novi "next year" did you just call me a dumbo bumbo no novi lol his estimate is way off oh i just never heard dumbo bumbo before me neither until now wow kevin just wow twice in one day :anguished: :fearful: :sob: :cold_sweat: :weary: how do you memorize all these smileys you're a genius i don't all i know is fearful but you just put 5. i clicked the thing for the other ones what thing i used the browser lel in the right in the text box :tired_face: U mad its different??? wut there are more emoji there :busts_in_silhouette: :us: :guardsman: :sleepy: :mushroom: :weary: novi you hauled in so many goodies for me in the wasteland :simple_smile: ? my level 33 guy w/ max charisma and a bunch of other solid stats i sent you to go explore the wasteland and you found so many goodies without dying yet :simple_smile: you're also probably the father of like 1/4 of the vault Borderlands?

like i fought manbearpig at like level 6 I'm not entirely sure, but yeah I think and i got like level 11 equipment LOL oh lel and i was like wtf the items don't scale they're static yeah thats what i saw there aren't THAT many weapons in the game so i have hella random weapons that i cant use yet because i do sidequests first instead of the main quests it's fun doing some of the sidequests but sometimes if you fight a lot you get overleveled yea i fight everytime i think im pretty overleveled whenever i fight the elves i one turn them and dont take any damage... p much man whos the best buddy i used kenny for a while and just used the kenny blows rat swarm every turn LOL the rat swarm did p good damage and hit every enemy later on you get like stan i currently have stan which is decent and jimmy ah okay i just got to the part and then you get cartman and kyle with the elven kingdom oh shet and they do some mad deeps kyle has the best partner aoe damn dats ridiculous and cartman has good aoe and single target damage well i liked kenny butter butters is better for boss fights fuck butters the heal is handy orly?

i'll ask the guy whos organizing. i was mainly worried about car space they're my coworkers Like well enough to to party with them? uhh i've gone out to bars with them a couple times Then ya dude Accept yah okay i'll ask the dude organizing he says itll be cheap cause he was planning on having everyone stay at his frat lol do frats have that much extra space? over the summer hell yeah they're multi room mansions or at least the ones at UIUC ohh okay prolly is he went to USC USC has dat old money forgot it was summer USC has a big greek life yah sounds about right isn't that true for a lot of private schools eh, it's more true for public schools since they tend to have larger overall student bodies berkeley didn't have that large of one i think less than like 10% of people were in greek life my coworker at dartmouth said like over 50% of people were in greek life Depends on the school Also I'm not the most informed on national Greek trends ah seems reasonable man I don't wanna do any more work today lel I've almost been here for 8 hours now then go home isn't that what you normally do anyway gonna stay for a bit longer, I'm still trickling some dregs of productivity gonna go check out my new gym today the aerobic machines have internet access and might have netflix hue hue hue wait did you move? or just get a new membership I moved to the city a few weeks ago oh wait so you've never worked out in chicago yet i meant like move gyms nope I wasn't even living at my place until like a week and a half ago I was couch surfing basically and then I had to go look at some gyms turns out that the gym in my office building is the best choice ohhh nice how much do you get for gym benefits square cheaped out on us :disappointed: after 3 years they'll pay for whatever gym membership otherwise all we get is a $100 per month membership to the gym in our building which is heavily discounted off of the usual cost and we don't have a signup fee this gym doe...it's p swanky it's basically a country club ohh wait so you pay $100 yourself? for now we used to get $100 / month for any gym membership but now its $50 per month. but now everyone can get it it doesn't have to be for gym it could be for "wellness" like massages and acupuncture since only half the people used to be using it for memberships lel $50 per month for a happy ending and I pay $100 out of pocket per month and they basically are paying $100 for me to join the gym since the monthly cost is ~$200 not including the $500 membership initiation fee oh okay that makes sense thats still pretty sweet if its swanky we used to have a nice one called sports club LA that was fully covered but since not enough people go to it and its much more than $50 it isn't covered :disappointed: :disappointed: I have no excuse not to work out right now i just went yesterday i sucked so much the CTC office has a private staircase right into the gym's locker room after a month of vacation and the staircase is 15 sec away from me lel you must be sore yah... although it wasn't as bad as the first couple times like 6 months ago getting DOMS for the first time is by far the worst I once had them so bad I was limping for 2 days did you use muscle cream/take some ibuproufen?

Why not one of your managers or something? my tech lead is on vacation and so i was the person who set up the call Sheeeeit putting the team on your back and i was the lead person doing all the talking wut is business Damn so responsible how do i business offer to take them to a strip club when they come they wont be coming to the us its a technical call send some strippers to their office then I guarantee you that they'll do business with you i dont need them to do business with me :disappointed: you're missing a great opportunity lel why if you sent a hot, busty australian blonde to grind on this guy's junk don't you think that for the rest of his life he'll be a totally usable part of your professional network? ???????????? do you get it???????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????????????????? (^: no why do i need him to be in my professional network i understand the first point but not the second one idk, maybe you'll fall in love with a dame from down under and move to Australia at which point you'll need business contacts there lol maybe why wouldn't she move here thats the biggest question isn't australia also a furnace? and do a lot of Irish people take summer classes at :uiuc: novi? well yah its pretty near the equator isn't it? and its also pretty like dangerous idk why anyone would wanna live in australia prolly why only 24 million people live there lel :like: All convicted felons of the UK lol there was a joke about australian immigration asking a guy from the UK about random stuff and the punchline is do you have a criminal history? and he responds. oh i didn't know that was still required top kek ayy we beat :de: lmao yeah i saw that 2-0 we da bes we gon win a 3rd world cup!!!

instead of dying because you were too coked out of your mind and did something retarded you made a difference in the lives of 14 people and went on to become one of the leading philanthropists of the Chicagoland area they'll name buildings in UChicago and NU after you and your contributions to financial research you will have become a respected mind in the field of finance and tech doing interviews on live TV on like Bloomberg and stuff when people want your expert analyses about current and future market trends or you could die because you were too coked out of your mind and the hooker on top of you gave you too good of a time and your heart just collapsed or something wow dats dark if it's one thing i hate about OSX it's fucking window switching why can't it just be like windows alt-tab what a transition wut its just command + ` yeah but between applications and stuff like i have to dick around with command ` and command tab but its ez it is what i hate but it's an extra step is when cmd + ` breaks for chrome then i have to restart chrome :oo: because chrome is fuckin stupid what the fuck?

what do you think iono if you knew him better or not he put in a ton of effort yeah he did not do well at stanford. anthony was like he heard hes also a pretty meh software engineer i guess i mean like, was he not smart enough to do well in HS otherwise and HAD to put in the effort? i have no idea i just remembered in high school i didn't study for any tests besides like math i sucked at math. :disappointed: but like for chemistry i just studied and memorized stuff on the drive to school lol for mr. lee's tests i remember when he asked you and people in my carpool was like wtf are you doing how you studied and you said you played WoW or something lol LOL i didn't play wow back then you basically didn't say you studied at that point anymore that's all i remember i didn't study said you didn't* and everyone else was like i legitimately didn't "i did the book problems" "i reviewed my notes" and you were like (paraphrased) "i didn't study" lmfao cause you three scored the highest on the test oh yeah i actually think he was like nice to me after that he wasn't like thats bad he was just like well done. i failed the first test though didn't a lot of people fail that one? memorizing the stupid fucking elements that was so dumb i thought i was dumb i got like a 70% or something u r dumb :heart: :^) but then every chapter after that i got like top 5 one of my few A+s was in that chem class LOL A+ in high school too real and i never studied. kelvin is 2smart Valedictorian GG so thats why. i wanted to be a chemical engineer SIKE how did you hear that Alex is a meh software engineer? where does he work? he went to yahoo as an intern last summer anthony told me he failed chemistry/bio classes switched to cs and didn't do much better oh that's unfortunate :disappointed: i'm probably meh, too :disappointed: its okay you're a front end engineer except for CSS!!!! :simple_smile: who cares if you're a meh software engineer :simple_smile: :^) yah i dont know any css ur a god 2 me nah, iono doe i just don't like digging around in the rails app just not fun, to me i like fucking around in the front end's CSS and JS and making things responsive why did i study CS, i should have just gone to vocational school lel lel i really like the back end stuff how everything works but i was a systems guy yeah, i don't dislike doing stuff in the back end, but to me it's definitely not as fun to work on i think working on front end for me would be like 8/10 and backend would be like 6/10 ahh i see i actually have the most fun though working on implementing something on both ends like adding a new thing entirely front end and back end that's 9/10 imo and no work at all is 10/10 :simple_smile: damn wow might as well just be a manager get taht 10/10 work style what do you think you want your career path to be? you wanna be a manager down the line? idk actually i think being a manager is interesting iono if i do though i was thinking maybe i shoul d get an mba i saw this program at Northwestern that i was kinda interested in not sure how valuable it would be though it's an M.S. in Law uh not a J.D.? and it just goes over various tech-related law stuff wtf it's like a crossover between JD and MBA is kinda how they described it like with classes in IP/Patent law for example yeah but who would hire someone that can do both maybe smaller startups... but i would rather trust a consultant lawyer who passed the bar and has prolly worked in a law firm before thats just my opinion maybe its a real thing. well the way the thing is promoted is that if you want to work in a role that's kind of a crossover between consulting lawyer and some technical role iono, it seemed interesting, but yeah not sure i mean i see how its promoted but i was wondering who hires for that position. yeah i'm not sure, maybe i'll ask my PM when he's back from vacation and see what he thinks since he def knows more about the business side of things lol sure let's go get MBAs from Haas :simple_smile: why not GSB lets all go to GSB :simple_smile: is that supposed to refer to UChicago's graduate school for business? or is it supposed to be something else does Haas even do MBAs? ... yes Haas does MBAs wtf how do you not know GSB because i don't know random acronyms :disappointed: like i would assume GSB stood for graduate school of business at first but that's so generic this is why i asked you because my top results are Glenview State Bank UChicago and then Stanford what the fuck although i guess you probably meant stanfrod now that i think about it lol yes stanford people know it as GSB its either HSB or GSB i didn't see it the first time didn't scroll down lol its those 2 or bust those are where the real connections are made what do you see in an incognito window when you type in GSB (i know geography still makes a difference) glenview state bank uchicago stanford oh depaul utexas my top 10 is all stanford gsb graduate school banking in madison lel and then a yahoo finance link sorry top 8 fine let's go to HSB this is what i see uploaded a file: image at 2015-07-10, 11:24 AM> sorry im bad its GSB versus HBS GG im fucking stupid not even gonna bother reading what you guys wrote u tricked me anyways it's just about business schools and MBAs and shit kevin do you see though my gsb yeah i basically only get stanford damn, what if i go to Booth or Kellogg up until opiegsb am i wasting my time? yeah. lol you really think it's THAT big of a difference? well education wise no connections wise yes yeah that's what i meant is it THAT big? i would say so that it would just straight up be not worth it?

Makes no sense It's allowed in cities not really sure i imagine it's just because drones/quadcopters and stuff they haven't really been classified properly yet by the FAA? so it's just a catch-all ban of flying over national parks i guess unless you apply for a business permit for like heli-tours and shit at least i think that's the reason holy fuck this is perhaps one of the most god awful stylesheets i've ever seen save me FUCK this shit man where are you guys to suffer with me Link? Examples? are you familiar with what a media query is? anyways, if you're not basically it's something you can do in the stylesheets to tell the browser to query the window's/viewport's current width and then determine which rules to apply to an element in the markup so 1) his fucking media queries are all at the top level and not at the lowest, inline level meaning for breakpoints of like 360px 480px etc etc etc i have to look through this fucking 600 line `.css` file in 5 different places instead of looking at them all next to each other so basically the way he does it is like ```
@media screen (max-width: XXX) {
 instead of ```
.rules {
 which doesn't seem annoying in this short snippet sorry i just got assigned a P0 and theres a status report in 2 hours i prolly wont finish in time but when there's a fuckload of stuff in each rule, i have to look through 50-150 lines over and over will not be responding for a while to find the ones i'm looking for and then worse yet, he's not even using the media queries correctly he's querying on `max-width` and then he'll set something like `width: 500px;` on `max-width: 991px` but on `max-width: 480px` he'll then set AGAIN `width: 500px;` so the SAME SHIT exists in like 5 PLACES when it doesn't need to because FUCKING `MAX-WIDTH` MEANS `&lt;` SO WHY IS HE REDOING EVERYTHING FOR EVERY WIDTH LESS THAN HOLY SHIT THIS IS SO AWFUL FUCK THIS GUY aight i'm done crying to you now, novi maybe you understood what i was talking about above If you worked on :league: it would be this all the time iono man this is fucking terrible Lolol They should fire that guy lol well he doesn't work here anymore he's someone else's problem now while this CSS is now my problem ss you know it's fucking real when i'm refactoring CSS and all of the rules (should) still work the same way and i have a net removal of ~82 lines so he had 82 lines that were purely useless holy fuck Hahaha I don't think I've ever faced production code that bad i imagine it's only this bad because he was the sole owner of these stylesheets so no one ever told him "hey your code fucking blows a big one, refactor literally everything" Damn Kevin Shu ace dev Kevin can't wait to be a senior dev who shits on new hires He'll abuse them like he abuses me i'm still at work :disappointed: living that kelvin life Damnnn wtf? Is this the latest you've been? yeah, but i've been around this late plenty of times before, too This is an amazing fuck you novi cum pick me up ;^) Just had umami burger and a protein shake I'm in no position to move damn i just had a jumbo chili cheese dog from portillo's and some fries p solid :+1: aight i'm peaceing out How did you get portillos but still were at work? he can get it delivered for free because he works at a tech company :simple_smile: Wut yeah company has an account on seamless after 7 i just order w/e i want and get it delivered ezpz Nice Damn Kevin too hard working im still here :O :O :O :O :O :O at work? or where? at work obvi nice are you leaving soon though? when did you get in? wait who kelvin? kelvin always works from like 10 to 10 :^) damnnnnn what a great employee although that means kelvin will never get to play cs go with me :disappointed: wait you got your computer??? no he hasn't GGGGGG .... but yah i typically get home around 9 to 10 i don't work from 10 to 10 i leave around 7:30 and then go to the gym but today im working pretty late too many fires GGG this is some wizard level shit hi whats so wizardy about it its juts low level stuff did you read about the jank stuff you can do with it? things I didn't know that the jvm allowed you to do with native java code? yah. i mean i expected its gonna happen every language has to implement it at some point hey novi if you're not based off of another language below it wanna do dinner? like a lot of the interpreted languages have C or Java backing it did you take a programming languages class novi? and tfti kevin hey kelvin wanna do dinner? yeah, we can skype each other during dinner :wink: :wink: your coworkers will be like why are you skyping these autists and watching them eat :disappointed: lel, fucking calling league teammates "coworkers" its okay i'll bring it downstairs :^) and go to a phone room damn, 2 cool my dinner is good today! my lunch is avg Entree

I hate hipchat with a passion why do you hate it so much lol Mobile is garbage it's just a wee application :^( the mobile app _looks_ okay its not the same but i don't like how it doesn't leave your conversations marked as unread and the security is terrible It just kept logging me out and I never got notifications from my team isn't slack's security also terrible?

:confused: i'm just doing work from here :disappointed: lazy fuk shower and be a member of society why is this being lazy :disappointed: i did and i also shaved and put on after shave you fuccboi stand shoulder to shoulder with the commuters lel WOW xd dank :dank: dude today it was basically grind central on the blue when I took it i got dressed and i ate lunch too you fucking assho :^( i'm just listening to music through my speakers while doing manual regression testing and then later i'll go pick up my package from the package room wow you put on after shave? so i can bring you a dank board game it's just an after shave/lotion wow wowowowowowow but if i say i use after shave it sounds more legit getting fancy for novi to navdoop :wink: damn using alcohol based aftershave is bad for you i don't even shave everyday I haven't used it in years i shave every like 3-4 days it's not an alcohol based aftershave wat what is aftershave why do you need it I was commenting for kelvin ........... let me teach you about shaving Kelvin traditionally one begins by showering in warm water or soaking the beard in warm water this softens the hairs and makes the skin more supple beard? lel i just have hairs gg but yah i normally shave right after i shower that's because you're a ching chong chinaman Yea we can't keep up with the coconuts )): im not a dum dum now NOW one can optionally apply a form of pre-shave oil usually something along the lines of castor oil this makes the blade glide more easily over the skin and moistens it i change my blade once a year is that bad i cut my chin :disappointed: many people don't use it, and those who do often use a safety razor (like me) or a straight razor (men manlier than me) u srs m8? lel yeah im serious while doing pullups i buy a new razor every 2 years just wtf damn since the catridge that comes with it kelvin2tronk goes away i mean they only give 2 cartridges wtf do i do BUY MORE idk how online GG G_G dollar shave club idk which ones to buy g_g harrys dollar shave club harrys they give too many catridges i only need 1 a year cartridges* nah i feel like you should use at least like 4 lol I believe harry's cartridges might be the same as the ones that the dollar shave club gives out i use 1 probably more why more wtf this is mindblowing how freq do you shave? i shave twice a week maybe do you even use shaving cream? or lotion? or something? i use a shaving gel that i bought in the uk since it hasn't finished yet that's something at least NO GELS OR AEROSOLS ON THE PLANE KELVIN i buy shaving cream like once a year or so too I mean that's a different matter but it still seems like it's not frequent enough this is the one i have i had a check in bag so i can put it in kevin dun be dum I know what that is this lasted a whole year it's p OK what i do is i put a little bit of it mix it with water fir a shaving cream that isn't applied via brush and it becomes cream!! ^that's a good strat or it becomes foamy and thats good enough for me is it weird to not shave that much? it could very well be if your hair isn't that tough Just dry shave with an electric i do that when i go on trips but i still have like tiny hairs i can see I mean shaving varies person to person depending on how thick the hair is and how fast it grows when i use electric electric razors are garbage just pull the skin too much and don't cut close enough trimmers are a different matter yah thats why i only use it for travel when i can't bring a razor ive talked to my coworkers about this they were also weirded out by the fact i change my blades once a year they say it lasts like 2 weeks or something i mean i guess it depends on your facial hair, and if you don't think the blade's quality is degrading at all then w/e but i find it surprising that after like a couple of months you aren't like fuck this blade when would you go fuck this blade for me it would be after a few shaves it works noticeably worse at that point but I can stretch it for a few more if I HAVE to, but I almost never have to granted the blades I use are actual razor blades that cost very little but they're for safety razors but they're also really OP in terms of sharpness and quality i use those gillette shit how many blades is it? 2,3,4, or 5? uhh idk its been a while since i bought it prolly 3 OK Kelvin you need to change out your razor more frequently it's not good for your skin i just helped an old lady move a heavy cabinet :simple_smile: did she give you a cookie and a glass of milk?

Do we make food at my place? uh i mean if i drive us back to your place we could finally go get that hot dog place if you felt like it it's p cheap depending on what you get or you could make frozen pizza idgaf i'm not really that hungry atm anyways so it's hard to say we'll see when I come over I suppose Damn should I switch to shaving cream and a safety razor? use a str8 razer xD If you shave often and have heavy facial hair wow kevin why are you driving because i like to be stuck in traffic :simple_smile: then you cant drink :beers: :disappointed: "Cal may very well go from not reaching the tournament to a #1 seed, as Jaylen will be teaming up with consensus top ten talent Ivan Rabb in Berkeley..."

Gg I didn't gets good nights sleep :( I slept for nine hours And I still feel tired Did you really know that? You slept too much yeah i knew that the Reflections API is pretty scary at times lots of shit you could do lol main things that i used it for was to check what class it was and then calling the constructor and passing in the right fields for that constructor was pretty stupid didn't really need to do that for a school project kelvin is so cool what do you guys normally eat for breakfast? nothing :confused: wait why kevin its not healthy dont do that to yourself some honey nut cheerios in 2% milk + a banana a bit later and that's overkill for a school project lol novi I never needed to do crazy reflection BS until I had to write a dependency injection type of lib kelvin is a tryhard just know that :confused: honestly it probably made the design worse that he did that it might have been more clear if he had done it a more conventional way I didn't know how to eat Fage until I watched Silicon Valley lol i only eat pure fage we only have 2% qq total gotta get all dat fat apparently the ones with less fat is not that healthy for you either so might as well get all da fat but now ive been drinking a can of tea and eating 2 hard boiled eggs rip gotta tell HR look at number 1 basically diabeetz not having a scrub body is ez go to the gym and don't eat like a tard do i have a scrub body novi?

a few weeks? i did my first long run yesterday well "long" how long was long? it was only 4+ miles :disappointed: i guess that's aight maybe your shoes aren't tight enough? i found that i can actually run like 2-3 miles at a time if i just run at a slower pace lol yeah obv although that pace is 10 minutes per mile lel that's fine man as long as you keep going :+1: but i need to get it to 8:30 for 3.5 do you mean that you would run 2-3 miles at 6 mph the whole time? or you would avg 6 mph over the duration of that 2-3 miles? the former i feel like i brought up my stamina for this pretty fast by just pushing myself as hard as i could running at like 7.5-8 mph and if i needed a break run at 5 and just keep doing that wow so fit i mean i feel like i kinda was a little bit and then i just stopped running one day :confused: well i tried that i ran 7:30 miles and i couldn't make it past 1.3 miles my friend recommended running at a pace where you can breathe through your nose the whole time and that'll build up your heart which is what matters for some distance like i can run a 7:30 mile but if i walk for the rest of the 3.5 race lol why not just run at a pace where i feel comfortable the whole time and then push a little harder during the race does that make sense? yeah def i just liked pushing myself and then taking small breaks in between going hard mm my break is walking at 4 mph and my cooldown was walking half a mile at 4mph at 12% incline lol gotta work those calves too damn man, walking at 4 is hard :disappointed: i'd much rather jog at 5-5.5 im too fat to jog i bet ur not fat :disappointed: i bet im fatter than u maybe, how much u weigh?

yeah writing async code isn't hard its just testing it is fucking annoying yah im not that stupid kevin :disappointed: who do you think i am :disappointed: a big dumbo :^) :disappointed: i'll never get anywhere in life because of your negative outlook for me i need to listen to sal khan and have a growth mindset my dick has a growth mindset maybe you should stick it in your ear and listen to it ... thanks novi thats helpful i feel so empowered are people around to play shit? no we're hard at work you government slacker I'm here :^) fuck u gary :simple_smile: when do you usually get in and leave? fuckin gary i get in at 8:20ish stop being on east coast time wow fuck you leave anywhere between 5 and 7pm i got in at 8:30 today im still here btw you've got a long working day why aren't you on slack asshole what? ??????? you mean during work? or what? yeah during work its just jason, kevin, novi and i just jerking each other off in here idk, i just don't look at slack really at work just haven't developed the habit damn ive developed a habit i'm too busy playing smash at work :^) lel this was posted in our slack at work :simple_smile: nice watch it its guuuud i did :simple_smile: gary get gud at cs:go and we can play on weekends!! :heart: fuck, i suck dick game's so hard :disappointed: whats your sensitivity? resolution? graphic settings? they're all important gary. i need to know! mouse dpi settings as well uhhhh i guess my sen/mouse dpi is pretty high resoultion is 1080p what graphics settings? wrong playing it all wron wrong lower your sens and mouse dpi my mouse dpi is at 400 dpi and roughly 1.5 sensitivity resolution should be 480p and lowest graphics settings for everything except blood you want to see blood so you know if you hit them you can slowly move up the graphics settings if you consistently get 120+ fps but dont change resolution you want things to be big and blocky. easier to shoot at it so rel okay also find a custom crosshair the default one sucks dog shit just google cs:go cross hair and type it into your console what's wrong with default? its just a steaming pile of shit way too large moves too much you dont know where your center is i should just use the custom crosshair i used when i played tribes lel what was that uh like a dot in the center and a diagonal line to it prob not good for cs i was also probably really shit last night because i didn't know about recoil and spray patterns but then i read about it after i played its good reading about it but its also good to just get practice with it. i know gonna focus on it when i play next time how are much are you supposed to burst each shot? i like 2-3 i also do things wrong and occasionally like to single shot lel im not good enough for dat :disappointed: so are you supposed to burst strafe stop burst ? yah pretty much you could also like slow strafe left and right while shooting if you walk slow enough it doesn't affect your aim im not dat good though :disappointed: how do you stop walking? do you do that thing where you tap the opposite direction? what some people do is they hold one way down and tap the other direction yah I just lift it up im bad damn before i know it gary is gonna school me i'm already doing all this research mang but nah i'll prob always suck a d btw you're playing on community servers right? i can only be good at gay ass shooters like tribes the people playing on valve servers suck big time but i also suck :disappointed: so i should just play with baddies i only play on valve servers to do the operation missions lol and im almost always top or 2nd frag -_- and i suck but right now, i'm like bottom of the scoreboard :disappointed: why what do you play just play dm i did and i just got rekt :disappointed: okay i'll play on the weekend with you only time i can actually play while you're awake unless you can play at like midnight your time... i probably don't really want to do that so yeah, only weekends :disappointed: :disappointed: dis gon suck :disappointed: no one else would play :disappointed: i dont understand why no one plays :disappointed: wut you guys think of this week's tavern brawl kelvin, do i only have to do the crosshair shit in the console once? or does it not persist? you need to edit a cfg file oh, gay yah it's dump fucking volvo tech debt gg kelvin, do you actually play on 480p? lel grooby blows a big one what a tryhard CSGO noob :^) I have friends who do But I play at like 1080 by like 720 or something Let me check when I go home can't do 480p it just looks too fucked up i'll do 720p i guess gary why don't you ever get on skype :disappointed: wtf nobody tells me too so i assume no one's on it's imblied :^( wow im on and no one calls me :disappointed: lets go play cs:go :disappointed: i see how it si is my baby is in prod and nothing broke hallelujah /giphy praise jesus lol pidgeot #birdjesus so are you out partying now that you launched? first thing to prod might as well take the rest of the day off sike I'll be working late today probs there are other problems I need to fix before I can deploy to the biggest trading desk so shit is still broken gg why aren't you a good engineer like kevin shu make thousand line diffs for no change :simple_smile: NICEUUUUUU I got my swag bag and ray bans from the party last saturday apparently someone had found it but they didn't know it was mine wut good thing my ray bans had my name on the box how did you lose it how drunk were you jesus I got drunk and left it at the club it was 3Am and I had been going since 7PM :confused: gotta be responsible man dont get too fucked up tomorrow dont die from alcohol poisoning pls errryyones gonna be buying you drinks for your 21st tomorrow isn't my birthday.... the party is scheduled for August 8th oh wait im dum my birthday is August 4th okay well august 3rd prepare your liver take a day off from work and just drink the whole day go to a random bar and casually show your id free dranks I can't take a day off work :disappointed: why i just spent the last 5 minutes trying to send myself "ayylmao" over sockets ayy lmao lmao so a girl I kinda knew for years and hung out with from time to time just got a new bf I was kinda into her and I think she might have been into me, but she had a boyfriend most of the time anyways, people told me that she may or may not be into me, but I basically ignored her, but whenever she was around she'd always come and say hi but now that she has a bf I get closure on the whole situation I can now peacefully tell her to burn in hell in my mind as opposed to wondering if there was any possibility there :^) I think that she was a tease but had no idea the mixed signals were strong with that one remember boys, non-single women are useless outside of the office remember when I was talking about how Rahul and Albert were churning munchery signup credit? uploaded a file: for iOS Upload> wow novi just wow just because theres a goalie doesn't mean you can't score novi you fucked up. I'm not that kinda guy m8 more and more I feel like I really should embrace that mentality but what if she was actually unhappy and she needed you to escape then she should break it off when a girl cheats it *it's a bad sign she needs you to protect her I don' *don't need that kind of drama in my life not worth mmm but you said she got a "new bf" what about that time in between too early for you to settle? I only have it a half hearted effort she wasn't even around for most of the time after she broke up with her bf because she graduated early or was taking classes near home or some shit regardless, over the years I knew her I realized that nothing long term could last I just wanted to hit it, but by the end it was so tiring to deal with her that I didn't care for it much all she was, I think, was a pretty face that liked to spend time with me wow thats harsh. so now what you're not friends anymore? we're still friendly but we never text each other or anything "Friendly" is different from being friends :disappointed: :cry: so you'd say hi when you see them but thats it hi and a hug but yeah oh are hugs normal she's actually less than useless to me now i think hugs are weird idk hugs are pretty normal mang i think its weird to initiate one it's weird if you're weird about it well i just dont initiate one thats it i never thought oh i should hug that person but when they initiate it then yah sure idk idk how to interact with people :confused: maybe just a little when I see a lot of female friends I give them a hug hello and a hug goodbye anyways, core lesson: never get hung up on a girl and if she gets a new bf she becomes p useless to you unless she has cute friends that like you if you ever get friendzoned or teased to oblivion, walk away and burn her memory from your mind she ain't worth it she's never worth it putting you in that situation implicitly means she ain't worth it damn life lessons from novi pls teach me more senpai ask me a question and ye shall receive thy answer I can tell you what to do in a specific situation or perhaps why spending lots of time with a non-single girl is less than useless lol we can talk in november we can all drink and share wouldn't that be nice? that would be gr8 i mean it all depends on what you want and what you think you can get ??? where have you been all day 2dank4u spending lots of time with a non-single girl is less than useless that's what i was talking about lol i agree with kevin for once like what if you're not interested and you're just friends is that useless i'm sure that's not what novi was getting at oh novi was just talking about the grab and smash wut like it's pointless to talk to people who aren't single 2 dank terms 4 me if you want to fuck them that's how novi's brain works oh damn novi is gonna have a tough married time when all his friends are also married if he finds someone worth marrying, i'm sure he'll change :heart: but what if be less of a fratstar he doesn't marry then gg novi is going to die alone he'll be that lechorous old man going to clubs in his 40s he'll be the pedo from family guy hitting on the 20 somethings uh if I'm married then the situation totally changes because then what I want out of a person also changes we're talking about the situation where you haven't married talking to a non-single girl that is the gf or wife of a friend is different but isn't it "less than useless" no because making the girl happy and being friends with her improves your own friendship with the guy whereas a non-single girl who is not the gf of a friend of yours offers you nothing more than an unfruitful timesink even if you guys are good friends? you can be good friends with a girl, but it's rare and there might be friend zoning involved and you also have to ask yourself if there were a romantic situation between you two while you were alone what would happen? i still don't understand the concept of friend zoning yeah mutually platonic relationships isn't a friendzone so i don't know what novi is talking about the way i've always understood it is that a friendzone is just when you want to be more than friends but she doesn't or vice versa and anyways, i've already talked to novi about this but i feel like if you're in a romantic situation between you and some girl who is not single 1) you were looking for it or 2) she was looking for it i feel like at any point prior to ending up in a "romantic situation" either of you would have had plenty of time to stop so i'm also not sure what novi's point was and holy shit, Fnatic went 18-0 in LCS? unreal that was abrupt Holy sheet Also Kevin and I are working under different situational assumptions wut fnatic is great at CS:GO too kevin! :simple_smile: who're the top 3 league teams currently based off of like elo probably 2 korean teams and then fnatic not in any specific order oh cs:go is like fnatic tsm and c9 nip is really good too but they haven't been playing well recently damn only those teams because koreans don't play CSGO :^) why dont they play thats the better question cause CS GO is a shit game :confused: ^ wtf none of you even play it i don't think you guys should hate on it :confused: :confused: :confused: :confused: they hate us cause they ain't us lel wut what is this trailer why dont you just play with us kevin :disappointed: rip i can't go home because i had too much to drink qq thats why you gotta work in sf..... holy fuck A+ 10/10 it's ACTUALLY s o g u d you guys I have enough gold for an arena run need to dinner I'll watch after bby pls halp me drafterino I'll wait doe nice so we doing something tonight?

Get us in p sure you and I can't participate in IPO's Shil at least I can't Is there like a 6 month ban on joining IPOs after you've quit? Or like a 1 year non-compete at other companies? What really? I went through the compliance (skimmed the hundred pages) but it sounded like I would just have to announce it to belvedere? So the doctor said that my leg is able to bear full weight so some PT dudes are gonna help me out in the afternoon But only after them pain meds :raised_hands::raised_hands: niiiiiiiice and as for the IPO thing, I would check on that I figure it would be a good idea to ask compliance about it if you are going to do that I'm saving my pennies to buy :square: Kelvin you better not scam us into thinking the IPO will be better than it is I'm going to :simple_smile: I'm comma convince everyone I know to do the same (: can i join y'alls in buying out SQRE? hell yeah if we buy enough we can be the new board of directors can we fire kelvin then? :simple_smile: we can run the company into the ground and fire everyone maybe the best course of action would be to become the new board and then move square's HQ into the Merch Mart :simple_smile: merch mart? wuts that i think it's the bottom floor of kevin's building lel no one wants to work there it's a massive building that used to be where Sears held a lot of their merchandise before that happens everyone will quit and is now a lot of various offices oh gg my b dont think you can migrate people from sf to chicago maybe you can if you keep the pay the same and then tell them your rent will be 0.5x as much wut about familes you're tearing them apart fuck them :^) everyone else can quit :square: only needs :kelvin: Exercise stock options? what a good response, slackbot lol shet well if we actually do IPO this year i gots prety lucky pretty* could've joined a little earlier but eh inb4 your IPO is worthless :disappointed: well yah i'll see it's okay the massive demand generated by 599USD will keep your valuation afloat well market cap at that point shet 599usd we'll all be doing so well then how can i help with dyelfitness gotta get in on that potential company early fuck i want in tooo on a side note are we doing fantasy football again this year?

jk 9/10 labor day draft??? i think i'm going to be back let's all fly out somewhere :^) or is that after 9/10 this was an interesting offseason Cabo? hey guys let's do our Fantasy draft is your qb gonna be jay cutler where they did the NFL Draft this year ???

I shouldn't have your company doesn't put in any money? I just figured I'd get an HSA since it was "free" wait "free" what does that even mean costs me nothing to have an HSA aren't all insurance plans free? no wtf why does it cost money? some plans are like some tens of dollars per month your company pays for it yeah your company pays for it they pay for most of it no they pay 100% for the employee wtf companies force the employees to pay part of it???? Kelvin do you not know how most companies work? i didn't know that existed dont they want to take care of you? why are they forcing you to pay dude it's like $50 if I want it but it should be free im getting paid $100 a month to be on an HSA lol guess you have OP healthcare? not even sure i mean its just aenta ppo aetna* thats what i had last year I know that with the regular insurance the deductibles and coverage are great yah our deductible is $250 and $10 copay per visit for our ppo plan mmk my hsa plan though tbh I'm not worried about insurance at all my deductible is $3k hahahah lel that's how it works thats how HSAs work but well cant you just not take insurance from your company? if your parents is better/free? (i honestly didn't know it costs you money to pick a plan) all my plans were free for me. and my parents companies, its always free for the employee and like an extra something for a family plan most companies aren't like that most of them have a small amount you pay each month I get free vision and dental though dats fucked up i thought everything was always free... are like HMOs cheaper? i never understood why anyone would pick an HMO when they all cost the same cheaper as in, for your insurance fee does your insurance cost you money? yeah like some tens of dollars a month like novi lol wtf wow okay i mean square too dank you get that extra like $20/mo :^( lol im on an HSA they give me $100 a month for that it feels so weird using a mouse and keyboard at work it feels abnormal ? like having a separate mouse and keyboard i normally work on my trackpad and macbook keyboard wow what a l33t hacker ... my desk is just too small ask square for an upgrade tell them you can't work under these conditions my desk is an upgrade lol its an adjustable standing desk either i can adjust my desk and have a small desk or sit/stand somewhere and have a large one dude you gotta get a large desk for that D-penis stat D-penis? wait do you have an office novi? no :disappointed: but I have a lot of desk space CTC has these large conjoined desk pods so each of us gets like okay yah my desk is like a body and an arm and an arm the other way if i was at a normal desk it'd be like armspan+ im a nub scrublord :disappointed: pls teach me how to be a cool fintech oh wait im also in fintech lel :disappointed: yeah but not really :stuck_out_tongue: pls even i have bigger deskaroonie kelvin but can yours move up and down?!??!? i love how theres so much thats been written about this As it became clear that the Ideal Gas Law could explain the pressure drop in the footballs used by the New England Patriots, the NFL front office began to leak ancillary details that could be taken to incriminate the team lmao ideal gas law so real such chemistry much thermodynamics did you get your new place with shil and prithvi? we should soon, shil just submitted his app recently wait btw kevin why did you have to go to the office cant you do it all online? fees lel avoid some fees paying in person w/ a check cant you like venmo /sq cash them or something 2DANK 2CALI ??? 2 :ca: no wtf oh. okay. is your landlord like an individual? no we went to an open house and put down our deposit so we were just there and wrote a check but i know other people who pay like that i would imagine those people are probably paying like individual owners and stuff? iono, i mean i can see me doing that if i were renting from some random dude but not from a large apartment management company that manages like multiple buildings okay. just wondering maybe they were ya my last place i did direct deposit they linked to my bank account online so i never went to the office i just paid everything online how much is your place? 3 br? yeah, i don't know how paying rent will work at the new place, because if the fee is like $35 each time that sux 4k? i'll just be dropping checks damn so much time on your hands 3br/3ba $3888/mo wow fuck floor 39 :^) thats cheaper than my 2br/2ba last year and i was on the pleb 9th floor i guess dropping checks is more complicated than just venmoing, but it's still like i just write the check while i'm upstairs and drop it off in a box on the way out of the building lol i don't have a checkbook. so fuck you.
